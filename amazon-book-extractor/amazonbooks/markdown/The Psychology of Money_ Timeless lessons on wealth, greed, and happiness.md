| 内容简介 | The Sunday Times Number One Bestseller.Over 7 million copies sold around the world.The original book from Morgan Housel, the New York Times bestselling author of Same As Ever.As featured on the Dr Chatterjee podcast Feel Better, Live More and the Diary of a CEO podcast with Steven Bartlett.Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.Money – investing, personal finance, and business decisions – is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life's most important topics. |

- **内容**: This book should be a must for every beginner investor if they want have a better understanding about how the market behaves and real benefit of passive investment vs active investment. Something like "The time and effort you put in your investment strategy are not directly correlated with its output"  is one biggest lessons of the book, this considering that 85% of the professional funds do not beat the market

- **内容**: I think it was a good book. It was will written and easy to read. I got a lot of good tips that I can put into practice in my personal life. However, I did think that the book could have delved deeper into the psychological factors that influence our financial decisions. Whilst I find the historical anecdotes interesting, I think that they sometimes overshadow the core concept of the book.

- **标题**: Totally changed my view on money
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 June 2024
- **内容**: This book is a fascinating blend of finance, psychology and philosophy, and all written in a very easy to read form. If only I'd read this at school, but then so often school doesn't equip us well for the practicalities of life. This book is not about 'how to get rich'. It's about how we view money, what it means to us, and most importantly what is enough for us? There's one fascinating anecdote: Joseph Heller, author of one of the world's biggest best sellers 'Catch 22' was once at a social gathering. Someone said to Heller that a fund manager there had made more money that day than Heller had made from the worldwide sales of his book over decades. Heller replied "But I have something he doesn't. Enough". That fund manager would never be satisfied with what he had. So who was truly the richest? There's lots more to this book. My biggest regret is that I didn't read it years ago. Whenever someone writes a rave review I'm always suspicious they have a vested interest. I don't. I'd never heard of the author until a friend lent me this book. Some books get us thinking in a very different way so that the book stays with us. This book is one of them.
