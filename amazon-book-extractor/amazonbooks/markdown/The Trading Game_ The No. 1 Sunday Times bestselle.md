| description | *NO.1 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER*'An unforgettable story of greed, financial madness and moral decay' Rory Stewart'Hilarious, shocking and deeply sad ‚Äï often in the same sentence' Sunday Times'The Wolf of Wall Street with a moral compass' Irvine WelshAn outrageous, white-knuckle journey to the dark heart of an intoxicating world - from someone who survived the trading game and then blew it all wide open'If you were gonna rob a bank, and you saw the vault door there, left open, what would you do? Would you wait around?Ever since he was a kid, kicking broken footballs on the streets of East London in the shadow of Canary Wharf's skyscrapers, Gary wanted something better. Something a whole lot bigger.Then he won a competition run by a bank: 'The Trading Game'. The prize: a golden ticket to a new life, as the youngest trader in the whole city. A place where you could make more money than you'd ever imagined. Where your colleagues are dysfunctional maths geniuses, overfed public schoolboys and borderline psychopaths, yet they start to feel like family. Where soon you're the bank's most profitable trader, dealing in nearly a trillion dollars. A day. Where you dream of numbers in your sleep - and then stop sleeping at all.But what happens when winning starts to feel like losing? When the easiest way to make money is to bet on millions becoming poorer and poorer - and, as the economy starts slipping off a precipice, your own sanity starts slipping with it? You want to stop, but you can't. Because nobody ever leaves.Would you stick, or quit? Even if it meant risking everything? |

Watts', 'rating': '5.0', 'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars\nGood  Will Hunting Meets the Wolf of Wall Street', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2025', 'content': "Ever wonder what would have happened to Matt Damon's Good Will Hunting character if he had gone into the finance world? Gary Stevenson's story tells us what. This is a compelling story of someone with big dreams but who discovered they come at a price. And who at the end of the day, never lost his connection to his humble roots and refused to sell out. Like the Will Hunting character, Gary is from a working class background but has genuis level maths skills. His story  takes him from the East End of London/Essex borders to the LSE and then on to trade on an international scale. The characters he encounters - even their egos, faults and foibles, are documented factually - but also with a touch of compassion. Certainly this is an eye-opener as to how the finance system operates. The high stakes game that is played out across world markets every day - the roll of a dice, calls into question just who is or should  be in charge of your money or the economy? And also the real price to be paid for the massive bonuses traders like Gary receive. I guess the next game for Gary is probably the Netflix series based on his book. As for the investment you make reading it - well worth it. Gary - thank you for sharing your story. One of my best reads so far this year.\nRead more", 'helpful_votes': '9 people found this helpful'}, {'reviewer_name': 'Jon', 'rating': '5.0', 'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars\nYou should read this', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2025', 'content': 'I read this book in one day it was so captivating. It‚Äôs an extraordinary autobiographical tale and one more relatable to me than I‚Äôm entirely comfortable admitting. If the grit and will to win in the book can be transposed (with less trauma!) to Gary‚Äôs mission to have policy informed by inequality, and the actual reality of failing economy for almost everyone, it will be a wonder to behold. There‚Äôs a moral intelligence to this tale without preaching or over simplifying a very real story. Amazing work.\nRead more', 'helpful_votes': '2 people found this helpful'}, {'reviewer_name': 'Darcy shaw', 'rating': '4.0', 'title': '4.0 out of 5 stars\nI don‚Äôt read books', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 March 2024', 'content': 'I don‚Äôt read books but for the first time in my life, I bought ‚Äòthe trading game‚Äô after over a year of watching this guy on YouTube. I was that excited about this book coming out that I pre-ordered it, something of which I never do! I find Gary fascinating and his mission is simple, to end wealth inequality! I will continue to support him in whichever capacity I can, I tell anyone I talk to about him and his mission, and yes, even my mum, Gary üòÇThe book itself is extremely detailed with the inner workings of trading and describes the culture of 90% of people involved in it. I found a lot of details around the game and intricacies with trading easy-ish to digest, but I follow the economy and politics anally! I guess the average person not so interested in these subjects may feel a little out of their depth, although Gary does do a decent job of simplifying. It was an absolute pleasure to read and was worth the wait of more than six months with your lack of YouTube videos! Well done!\nRead more', 'helpful_votes': '30 people found this helpful'}, {'reviewer_name': 'DHC1', 'rating': '5.0', 'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars\nPage turner- true story.', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 February 2025', 'content': 'Really enjoyed this book, gave good insight into trading culture along with  happy and sad true story, written in a way that kept me wanting to turn the page, some of it was dark comedy almost- would recommend.\nRead more', 'helpful_votes': '3 people found this helpful'}, {'reviewer_name': 'Douglas Porter', 'rating': '5.0', 'title': '5.0 out of 5 stars\nWhat a book!', 'date': 'Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 March 2025', 'content': 'I think that this is a very honest, heart felt, book.

I opted for the audio version and was pleased I had, the author narrates in a most engaging way and uses regional accents eg Scouse to very good effect.

As this happens, he realises there are fundamental issues with the economic system, and explains them here.The hardest bit of any book on investing is explaining how it works. Most people don't know much about it, so Stevenson dumbs it down a little, so it's accessible to the regular reader. He does an okay job explaining how it works.The book ends with a description of how the system works now. You can take it or leave his point of view, though I've felt that his argument has had some merit for a while. This said, you can enjoy the book, whatever your point of view. It will certainly make you think.\nRead more", 'helpful_votes': '3 people found this helpful'}, {'reviewer_name': 'Tijs D.', 'rating': '2.0', 'title': 'nothing new to any previous inside-the-trading room story', 'date': 'Reviewed in the Netherlands on 28 April 2024', 'content': "I normally would not write any book reviews but I'll make an exception for this book, since it has been strongly promoted and praised even in the Netherlands, but for me it was very disappointing.Yes, it gives some insights in the workings of the international financial markets and the cynical and ruthless role of big financial institutions and (mostly male) not-so-nice and social behaving people working there. But this offers little news since many books and actual news stories have told us this many times.The best story is the way the writer manages to get the job via -indeed- a game.After that, we're left with the experiences and views of the author trying to make more money than the rest.  But whilst I expected a twist nearing the end or some real and more mature insights in the workings of the sector and what should change,  that is not really there.  Though there is here and there the suggestion of some reflection and insights, this all stays very shallow  Poor kid with maths talent and ambition becomes rich and spoiled at a very early age, leaving the book mostly a testimony of a very egotistical,  money minded FX trader. Nothing new there, I guess.  Even his leaving the firm is not really about charity and changed views as is suggested.  It is about even more money and 'winning'.
