  "description": "“Spectacular…Offers a comprehensive indictment of the current problems and a clear path forward…Klein and Thompson usher in a mood shift. They inspire hope and enlarge the imagination.” —David Brooks, The New York Times From bestselling authors and journalistic titans Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, Abundance is a once-in-a-generation, paradigm-shifting call to renew a politics of plenty, face up to the failures of liberal governance, and abandon the chosen scarcities that have deformed American life.To trace the history of the twenty-first century so far is to trace a history of unaffordability and shortage. After years of refusing to build sufficient housing, America has a national housing crisis. After years of limiting immigration, we don’t have enough workers. Despite decades of being warned about the consequences of climate change, we haven’t built anything close to the clean-energy infrastructure we need. Ambitious public projects are finished late and over budget—if they are ever finished at all. The crisis that’s clicking into focus now has been building for decades—because we haven’t been building enough. Abundance explains that our problems today are not the results of yesteryear’s villains. Rather, one generation’s solutions have become the next gener­ation’s problems. Rules and regulations designed to solve the problems of the 1970s often prevent urban-density and green-energy projects that would help solve the problems of the 2020s. Laws meant to ensure that government considers the consequences of its actions have made it too difficult for government to act consequentially. In the last few decades, our capacity to see problems has sharpened while our ability to solve them has diminished. Progress requires facing up to the institutions in life that are not working as they need to. It means, for liberals, recognizing when the government is failing. It means, for conservatives, recognizing when the government is needed. In a book exploring how we can move from a liberalism that not only protects and pre­serves but also builds, Klein and Thompson trace the political, economic, and cultural barriers to progress and propose a path toward a politics of abundance. At a time when movements of scarcity are gaining power in country after country, this is an answer that meets the challenges of the moment while grappling honestly with the fury so many rightfully feel.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2025",
      "content": "This book is exceptional. I happened to get my copy a few days early and absolutely tore through it. If you, like many of us on the left, have been left feeling adrift and a bit hopeless in the last few years, you need to read this book.It offers an extremely compelling vision for the future. A vision of the left that works, that builds, that grows, and that can work to create a better future for us all. Klein and Thompson take you on a journey, one that exposes all of the flaws and non-workings of the left over the last few decades. They pull no punches. If what you want is a book that blames 100% of our countries problems on the GOP then go back to your cocoon and leave this book alone. It viscerally exposes the way that liberalism has failed to achieve it's very own goals and objectives. The left didn't die because the GOP killed it, the left withered by virtue of its own poor governance. The book shows the myriad ways that us, and the politicians we vote for, have been the hinderance to change that we all know that our society needs.It's not an easy read - not because the prose is difficult, it's extremely well-written - but because it puts the onus of responsibility for fixing our society back on the ways that we on the left have failed. This moment seems hopeless, but after reading this book I also feel firmly like we have never been better positioned to actually move ourselves forward.And in the end, this book left me with hope. If we are lucky, this book will go down as one of the most importance political texts of the last 100 years. Read it, tell everyone you know to read it, write to every politician you know and tell them to read it as well. Then get to work doing what you can to Build the American Future.\nRead more"

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2025",
      "content": "I can't believe anyone's buying this book. The reason California isn't succeeding in completing all these pie-in-sky projects is the state doesn't have the money. Affordable housing requires a government subsidy for the cost of expensive land and building materials as well as prevailing wage labor and there's no money for subsidies. High-speed rail promised a cost of $30 billion to go from Los Angeles to San Francisco by 2020, now the latest is $33 billion to go from Merced to Bakersfield, the easy part, by 2033. The state needs to bail on HSR immediately. The state and federal government have been providing people with tax credits to buy Teslas for many years and now kooks are demanding Tesla owners get rid of the cars they got a subsidy for buying. It's insane.\nRead more"

However, as a longtime devotee of the work of Matthew Yglesias, his former podcast co-host, most of this is old news.In Abundance, Klein and Thompson have basically given the masses a Yglesias for Dummies, which is great if these ideas are new to you! I sincerely hope Democrats pick this one up and actually read it. We need to change and we need to do it fast.\nRead more"
