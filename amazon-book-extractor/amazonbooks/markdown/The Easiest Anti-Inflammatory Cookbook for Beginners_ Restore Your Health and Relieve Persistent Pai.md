- **评分**: 5.0
- **标题**: Number one in ease of use, the most useable recipes, readily available ingredients,  tasty.
- **日期**: Reviewed in Canada on 24 February 2025
- **内容**: If I could only have one anti-inflammatory cookbook, this would be my choice.  It is easy to read and understand, and is setup very well.  A majority of ingredients are common to my pantry so I don't have to buy ingredients which I might only use once.  I don't know from which country the author comes but I did have to Google some ingredients (for example, I did not know that rocket is arugula, and linseed is flaxseed).  I very highly recommend this wonderful cookbook.
