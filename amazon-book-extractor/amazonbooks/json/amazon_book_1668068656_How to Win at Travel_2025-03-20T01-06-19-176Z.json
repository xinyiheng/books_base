      "content": "I am 55 pages into this book and it's already saved me $307!! I had a car rental booked in Denver Colorado for 1 week for $651. I had shopped about 3 different sites and comparing prices before I had booked it and at the time thought it was the best deal. However, finding out about Autoslash.com in Brian's book, I plugged in all of the same requirements, same class of vehicle and ended up securing a vehicle for $344!! I have been retired for about 2 years now and have a lot of traveling that I want to do and this book is providing me with a plethora of new information. I always thought I was fairly savvy at this, but this book is providing so much more. I have to highlight info as I go through an also make notes in a separate book to make sure I follow up on all the tricks of the trade. I highly recommend this book....I am not a \"reader\" but when it comes to saving money, I'm all in on the research and tools.\nRead more"

My beef is that it is geared towards those with elite status who hold millions of miles with credit cards/airlines and not for those of us who are not elite status holders. Also, as a Canadian I skipped through many pages where he writes about America credit cards as this was of no use to me. I recommend if you are a VERY frequent flier who has millions of miles and lives in the USA, otherwise pass on this book.\nRead more"
