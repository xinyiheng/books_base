Anything above zero compounds

- **内容**: "Dramatic progress is not made dramatically...it's all about the tiny changes that stack."  What an exceptional experience this book offers with its clear and engaging flow, guiding you through the five types of wealth while leaving their definitions open to actions of your choosing. No matter what season you are in -- balanced or unbalanced -- if you are in your 20s, 30s, 40s or 50s and know deep down you were built for something you are not doing, this book will speak to you.  And if you listen, you will feel truly comforted by the fact that you already have the answer.  And now you have an action plan. How fortunate are we to have found such a sensible guide?!

A great handbook for life - should be required reading in high school
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2025
- **内容**: An incredibly valuable, clear-eyed, and immensely practical read. Collates the best thinking across thousands of tomes, distills it into easy to access practices and principles and offers practical guides, tools and thinking to put the principles to work, in your life.I think it should be required reading for every high school graduate. Don't wait to tread the same consequence-ridden path the rest of us took. Dive in, understand your unique principles and goals, and build the foundations for a broad, balanced, nourished life.Sahil has done the work, listened to the masters, consumed all the great works and live it. His authentic voice and personal stories make it highly accessible, relatable and laudable.  Thank you for a great handbook for life.

The Best Gift To My Children
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025
- **内容**: 5 Types of Wealth is one of the most insightful and transformative books I have ever read. I only wish I had it 10 or 20 years ago, as its wisdom would have shaped many of my life decisions for the better. But what excites me even more is that my two teenage daughters will have access to these lessons at a stage in their lives where it can truly shape their futures.What makes this book exceptional is its holistic approach to wealth. Unlike traditional finance or self-help books that focus solely on monetary success, it expands the definition of wealth into five critical dimensions: financial, social, physical, mental, and time wealth - each playing a crucial role in living a truly rich life. It challenges the common pursuit of money at the expense of everything else and instead offers a framework for building a truly fulfilling life.One of the most impactful takeaways is the emphasis on time wealth—the ability to control how you spend your time rather than being trapped in the relentless pursuit of more money. The book makes a compelling case that accumulating financial wealth without securing time wealth often leads to imbalance and regret. Similarly, it highlights the compounding effect of non-financial wealth, such as the way strong relationships, continuous learning, and physical well-being create long-term advantages in ways that money alone never could.Beyond being thought-provoking, this book is extremely practical. It provides a practical roadmap for balancing the different types of wealth, while ensuring that success in one area doesn’t come at the cost of another.It’s a must-read for anyone seeking long-term fulfillment, and I’m especially grateful that my daughters will have this wisdom as they navigate their own paths.

A Wealth Framework For Students, Scientists & Engineers
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2025
- **内容**: Sahil Bloom’s The 5 Types of Wealth is a must-read for anyone who thinks wealth is just about money. It completely reframes success—not just for billionaires, but for ordinary people like professors, postdocs, grad students, and even Nobel Prize winners.Most books focus on financial success, but this one introduces a broader, more meaningful concept:1️⃣ Financial Wealth – Money, assets, investments. Useful, but not everything.2️⃣ Social Wealth – Relationships, reputation, community. Your network is your net worth.3️⃣ Physical Wealth – Health, energy, vitality. Even Einstein knew the importance of daily walks.4️⃣ Mental Wealth – Knowledge, clarity, resilience. Learning compounds like interest.5️⃣ Time Wealth – The ultimate currency. Grad students? You’re Time Billionaires.This book is a wake-up call. Wealth isn’t just a number in a bank account—it’s how you spend your time, who you surround yourself with, and how you take care of your mind and body.No matter your net worth, this book is worth your time. Highly recommend! 🚀
