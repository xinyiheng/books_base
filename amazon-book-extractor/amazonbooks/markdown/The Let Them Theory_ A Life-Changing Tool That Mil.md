The Let Them Theory by Mel Robbins – A Life-Changing Perspective
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2025
- **内容**: The Let Them Theory by Mel Robbins – A Life-Changing PerspectiveThe Let Them Theory by Mel Robbins is an eye-opening and transformative read that has completely shifted the way I approach relationships and personal growth. The core message—letting people be who they are instead of trying to control or change them—is both freeing and empowering.Mel’s insights are practical, relatable, and backed by real-life examples that make the concept easy to apply. This book has helped me release unnecessary stress, stop overanalyzing others’ actions, and focus on what truly matters—my own peace and happiness.Whether you’re struggling with boundaries, relationships, or simply want to feel lighter and more in control of your emotions, this book is a must-read. It’s a refreshing reminder that the best thing we can do is let them—and focus on becoming the best version of ourselves. Highly recommend!

What a great liberating book that comes at just the right time!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025
- **内容**: I love this book so much!  This book focuses on what I call the new liberation model versus the old model that was conditioned and programed into us that we currently find ourselves currently mirrored in with components of power, control, stress, fear, elitist, immaturity, righteousness (need to be right), polarization, narcissism, stubborn, rigid and/or chaos, negativity bias, over-thinking, complaining, know-it-all, judgmental, critical/hyper-critical, egotistical (ego) (selfish/group selfishness), contradictory, hypocritical, comparison, competitiveness, fighting & arguing, fragmented society, entitlement, perfectionism, identifying/over-identifying with your thoughts and beliefs, mechanical society, ideological, misery, victim mentality, we are right and your group is wrong/we are good and your group is bad, drama triangle & drama addiction, neuroticism, codependency, terrible at relationships (especially with people who think or believe differently than you and with people who can think outside of the current box/boxes), increased mental health issues & increased medical health issues and lots of news addiction & social media addiction and political addiction/political righteousness /political radicalness too.Thank you to those (like Mel Robbins) that are doing deeper mental health therapy work on themselves to be better human beings, transform themselves,  and to be better version of themselves.  Mel is a great example of a genuine, vulnerable, real, whole and authentic role model and a real leader in our society!The other books that are like this are: "Liberated Love",  "Unhealthy Helping", "Beyond Anxiety" and "Dissolving the Ego",  "The Way of Integrity", "On Fear"and "Living Untethered"Remember, the younger generation is watching and witnessing all of this toxic & dysfunctional mess. Hopefully, the younger generation will learn from this and not be anything like the older generations.Please do us all a big favor and go work on yourselves with mental health therapy work. Working on yourself is the only true, real, authentic way to transform a society. Anything less, is just superficial, shallow, and surface level change. Pease look at my first paragraph and I think most humans will see many items in that first paragraph to work on in therapy.Most of the human traits in my first paragraph are terrible for your relationships and connections in general.It is interesting that the USA Western culture teaches and trains people to be in your own ego and  (the ego is the highest priority)  The USA mantra is "Your own ego and what your ego or what the group ego wants is all that matters" and "I have all the answers"(ego) where the Eastern culture has their highest attainment is enlightenment and self actualization and they teach their culture that: "We do not have all the answers" (humble).  The Eastern mantra is "Drop your own ego and work towards self actualization and enlightenment".  I wonder what culture is doing better right now?You could also try a meditation class or a yoga class (or do one on youtube) to see if you can calm down your brain, body, mind, and your ego!  It might also improve your relationships if you are in a calmer, flexible and more loving state of mind.  Plus, you might gain more creative problem solving skills.

easy read, clear and useful theory
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2025
- **内容**: Very useful theory, down to earth, clear and easy to read.  Has helped me in a number of ways.  Biggest is personal responsibility just for my own emotions, feelings, life outcomes and how to separate myself from letting others affect me profoundly which is a useful concept.  I gave the book four stars, not quite five as one additional piece of information would have helped.  That is, how to actually not permit others to affect one and how to ensure we focus only on our own issues and what we can change.  Its concept wise great, needs a bit more practical of how to do what I would describe as gargantuan tasks like separating the self, especially if one spent a lifetime enmeshed with others.  I think the reason why is that Mel herself likely needs time to consider how to actually accomplish it in her life, although I know she makes every effort, she explains she struggles too and therein  lies the next challenge.  Perhaps a part two or  addended version later with the “how to” in numerous practical examples that are enormous challenges for the codependent which is in essence, in my opinion, who this is written for the most . Still, it is an excellent piece of literature .

A MUST READ FOR EVERY SOUL ON THIS PLANET!!!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025
- **内容**: This book is beyond life transforming. It is healing and it will change your perspective on yourself, on others and on your whole life forever and you wont' be the same again while and after you read this amazing book. It helps you to discard your past as easy as a used tissue paper which you may need to wipe away some of the tears of joy or tears of relief. This is one of the books which I cannot put down because it  has so much valuable information in it that I am absorbing everything like a sponge. It is simply breathtaking and so awesome and is a great addition for the ones who are so courageous to go to therapy or a gentle replacement for the timid ones who are afraid of any therapy. It is the greatest gift you can give your friends, your family members or simply anyone you care about because it encourages everyone to embrace the sweet personal steps of individual change naturally. I am just blown away how it easily this Mel assists every dear one to move forward in and with life and get out of any dead end street and start improving all relationships. Smile and have fun reading it. I send you all a big encouraging hug.

Let me say this was a fantastic read and influence!!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2025
- **内容**: I found myself smiling and enjoying this book all the way through it.  I wrote a book myself that didn’t do all that great and I thought it should have done great—what I got reinforced by Ms. Robbins is the idea that the markets, like the sky will do what they want, but I have the power to control my response.  I felt Ms. Robbins gave some pretty firm advice and food for thought all the way through the book.  I was inspired by her energy, good will and enthusiasm.  Thank you.  Highly recommended.
