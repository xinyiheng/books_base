| 作者简介 | Walter Isaacson is writing a biography of Elon Musk. He is the author of The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race; Leonardo da Vinci; Steve Jobs; Einstein: His Life and Universe; Benjamin Franklin: An American Life; The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution; and Kissinger: A Biography. He is also the coauthor of The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made. He is a Professor of History at Tulane, has been CEO of the Aspen Institute, chairman of CNN, and editor of Time magazine. |
| 内容简介 | By the author of the acclaimed bestsellers Benjamin Franklin and Steve Jobs, this is the definitive biography of Albert Einstein.How did his mind work? What made him a genius? Isaacson’s biography shows how his scientific imagination sprang from the rebellious nature of his personality. His fascinating story is a testament to the connection between creativity and freedom.  Based on newly released personal letters of Einstein, this book explores how an imaginative, impertinent patent clerk—a struggling father in a difficult marriage who couldn’t get a teaching job or a doctorate—became the mind reader of the creator of the cosmos, the locksmith of the mysteries of the atom, and the universe. His success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for free minds, free spirits, and free individuals.  These traits are just as vital for this new century of globalization, in which our success will depend on our creativity, as they were for the beginning of the last century, when Einstein helped usher in the modern age. |

Isaacson's meticulous research and engaging storytelling.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2023
- **内容**: Walter Isaacson takes readers through the extraordinary life of the renowned physicist Albert Einstein. Isaacson's comprehensive biography not only captures the essence of Einstein's scientific contributions but also delves into the fascinating aspects of his personal life.Isaacson's meticulous research and engaging storytelling make this biography a captivating read. He masterfully presents Einstein's complex scientific theories in a way that is accessible to readers of all backgrounds. Whether it's relativity, quantum mechanics, or the photoelectric effect, Isaacson ensures that even the most intricate concepts are explained clearly and without unnecessary jargon. As a result, readers gain a deeper understanding of the revolutionary discoveries that perpetually changed our understanding of the universe.However, what truly sets this biography apart is Isaacson's exploration of Einstein's personal life. Delving into his family dynamics, relationships, and political and social activism, Isaacson provides readers with a well-rounded picture of the man behind the genius. By examining Einstein's struggles and successes, his controversies and ethical dilemmas, Isaacson humanizes the iconic figure, making him relatable and understandable.Furthermore, Isaacson's prose is engaging and fluid, making the biography accessible and enjoyable to read. He skillfully weaves together historical context, scientific explanations, and personal anecdotes, creating a narrative that is both informative and entertaining. Isaacson's admiration for Einstein shines through in his writing, but he remains objective and portrays the scientist honestly, highlighting both his strengths and flaws.One criticism of the book is that it occasionally delves too deeply into scientific explanations, which may not appeal to readers without a strong background in physics. However, Isaacson's ability to seamlessly transition between technical details and personal anecdotes largely compensates for this minor flaw.In conclusion, Einstein His Life And Universe is a compelling biography that provides a thorough understanding of Einstein's life, science, and impact on the world. Walter Isaacson's meticulous research, insightful analysis, and engaging storytelling make this book a must-read for anyone interested in the man behind the theory of relativity.

Awesome book about a larger than life scientist...
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2007
- **内容**: Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson is an awesome book about a man who was larger than life.  Did I understand all of it?  Nope.  But that didn't keep me from enjoying it immensely.Walter Isaacson is known for his well-researched and well-written biographies of great men, and he was aided by the discovery of many of Einstein's previously unknown private letters in 1986.  After going through the basics, the author alternates between Einstein's personal life, his scientific work and his political beliefs.As a physicist, Einstein possessed a brilliant mind.  In 1905, he published four new theories that would change science forever.  An uninspired student in college, he was unable to get a teaching job upon graduation.  Instead, he ended up working for the Swiss Patent Office.  This actually proved beneficial as it allowed him extra time to work on his theories.  A humble man, Einstein believed that "knowledge is limited" and that curiosity and imagination were responsible for his discoveries.  Isaacson tries to explain these in an easy-to-understand manner, but I still found my eyes glazing over in spots.  By the end of his career, Einstein was no longer the innovative rebel but instead, the more conservative sage of Princeton.As for Einstein's personal life, the newly discovered letters allow Isaacson to write in more detail about the famous scientist than any other biographer.  This new treasure trove sheds new light on his first marriage to Meliva Maric.  Einstein had complicated relationships with both wives and his two sons, and he didn't always treat them admirably.  Yet, he was a very social man and had dozens of life-long relationships with other scientists and mathematicians.  Einstein was described as "kind, good-natured, gentle and unpretentious."  This quiet and unassuming man became our first celebrity scientist and hoards of fans flocked to see him.  In these respects, Einstein was much like Ben Franklin--another one of Isaacson's subjects.Einstein had strong political beliefs.  He was both a socialist and a strong pacifist.  But Hitler and Nazi anti-Semitism caused him to not only abandon his native Germany but also, to throw his weight behind the war effort.  Einstein also decried racism.  When Marian Anderson came to Princeton in 1937 to perform, the Nassau Inn refused her a room.  Einstein opened his Princeton home to her.Although Isaacson's biography is exhaustive, he leaves just a few questions unanswered.  First, whatever happened to his house in Caputh, Germany after the war?  I discovered on the internet that it has a fascinating history that I'm sure Isaacson's readers would enjoy.  Also, I wonder how the advent of the computer might have changed Einstein's accomplishments.  But these are only small issues in an almost perfect book.I was never very interested in Albert Einstein, but Isaacson has piqued my interest.  He succeeds in bringing to life this "locksmith" who "knows that math is the language nature uses to describe her wonders."

- **日期**: Reviewed in Australia on July 24, 2017
- **内容**: Another reviewer commented this book was too long... but it is a big story but I'm a bit of an Einstein groupie and really enjoyed the story.  Certainly some of the technical parts of Einstein's discussions with other physicists were hard to comprehend and like most laypeople I probably will never understand what Quantum Physics is about, but his personal story was well worthwhile.  Would that the world could throw up more people like Einstein for his political bravery as much as his scientific knowledge and insights.The book is well worth the read.
