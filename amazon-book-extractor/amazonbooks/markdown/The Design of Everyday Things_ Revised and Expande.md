| 作者简介 | Don Norman takes special delight in the interaction of people and technology. "Develop the skill of observation," he says, "and especially pay attention to the obvious, for this is where you will discover many hidden insights. What seems to be obvious often is not." Business Week has named him one of "the world's most influential designers," the influence from his books, essays, courses and students, lectures, and consulting.He is a fellow of many organizations, including the American Association of Arts and Sciences. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineers and former lots of things, including VP at Apple Computer, President of a startup, and co-founder of the Nielsen Norman group. He has honorary degrees from the University of Padua (Italy), the Technical University Delft (the Netherlands), and the University of San Marino. He was awarded the Benjamin Franklin medal in Computer and Cognitive Science and the Sir Misha Black medal for contributions to Design Education.He is known for his books "The Design of Everyday Things," "Emotional Design," "Living with Complexity," and "The Design of Future Things," but he is most proud of his students all over the world, who put into practice his human-centered design philosophy. His latest book is Design for a Better World: meaningful, sustainable, humanity centered" which draws upon his rich history to address some of the most pressing problems facing the world today. The real issues are not technical, nor can they be solved simply by technology. The most difficult is human behavior, which is why design can play such an important role. Design is a way of thinking, of solving the core underlying issues, combining a knowledge of technology, all areas of human activity, and most important of all, human behavior.He lives at www.jnd.org, where you can find chapters from his books and loads of essays. |
| 内容简介 | One of the world's great designers shares his vision of "the fundamental principles of great and meaningful design", that's "even more relevant today than it was when first published" (Tim Brown, CEO, IDEO).   Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door.   The fault, argues this ingenious -- even liberating -- book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization.  The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.  The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how -- and why -- some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them. |

A good read for shifting your perspective on objects and human behavior
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025
- **内容**: "We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be."This book tackles several aspects of design and interaction with objects. It states overarching principles plainly before providing detailed examples of the nuanced parts.From a designer/artist perspective, I appreciate how detailed the components are for creating something people will appreciate (rather than be confused by). From a customer perspective, I also appreciate how the author points out human behavior when interacting with poorly designed objects—I didn't know how to describe my thoughts and feelings in those situations before now.Overall, it's a good read for shifting your perspective on objects, human behavior, blame, business, and technology!

Useful information about how things SHOULD BE designed!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2021
- **内容**: I've just started reading this book - and I must say I am quite impressed.I've read a few reviews that essentially accused the author of being a cranky old guy complaining about how the world has changed - and I must agree with them. However, as far as I'm concerned, it's a message that needs to be heard. Not all change is good... and, many times, change makes the world more complicated to navigate... often in ways that are not at all helpful. Many modern products are very poorly designed when it comes to little details like practicality and usability. And too many designers of modern equipment and software expect their users to either already know how to use their product - or to be willing to do extensive research, or read a long detailed manual, before being able to use it. When I purchased my last new car I didn't need to read a book before being able to drive it off the lot. So why DID I need to look up the details about how to make a phone call on my new phone? Shouldn't how to make a simple phone call be simpler and more obvious than how to drive car? And, likewise, shouldn't it be obvious how to turn a lamp on and off? Doesn't this seem like a bit of a step backwards to you?Advanced features are very nice, and can be really handy once you understand them, and set them up, but you shouldn't need a manual to make a simple phone call. (If you were trapped in a burning building, and you found a phone lying on the floor, but it wasn't the same brand as the one you normally use, would you be able to figure out how to call 911 on it? And, for that matter, could you even trust that a modern hotel room would have a plain old light switch located at the normal spot on the wall next to the door?)My point is that this book provides an EXCELLENT perspective on the things we SHOULD be paying attention to when we design things... and it's great that someone is putting that sort of thinking into print, to remind us that designs need to be both attractive, functional, and practical, before we forget that little detail entirely.

Informative and Enjoyable Read
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2015
- **内容**: The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition by Don Norman“The Design of Everyday Things” is a very good sequel to the first edition of this book, “The Psychology of Everyday Things” published in 1988.  In this informative and enjoyable edition, educator and cognitive engineer, Don Norman provides readers with an interesting look at what constitutes good design. An advocate for user-centered design this is a helpful introduction to the world of design. This enlightening 370-page book includes the following seven chapters: 1. The Psychopathology of Everyday Things, 2. The Psychology of Everyday Actions, 3. Knowledge in the Head and in the World, 4. Knowing What to Do: Constraints Discoverability, and Feedback, 5. Human Error? No, Bad Design, 6. Design Thinking, and 7. Design in the World of Business.Positives:1. An accessible and well-researched book. Excellent resource for professionals in the field but intended for all to enjoy.2. The interesting topic of design in everyday products.3. Don Norman’s credentials are outstanding and his mastery of the topic is manifested from his astute observations based on experiences in engineering, cognitive science and business. “My experiences in industry have taught me about the complexities of the real world, how cost and schedules are critical, the need to pay attention to competition, and the importance of multidisciplinary teams.”4. A very good format. The book starts with a clear preface on where the book is going to take you.5. Good use of tables and charts to complement the narrative.6. Throughout the book there is an emphasis on what constitutes good design. It all starts with asking the right questions and Norman does a wonderful job of that. “Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding. Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them? Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?”7. Explains the differences between the three main designs discussed in this book: industrial design, interaction design, and experience design.8. Norman is an advocate for human-centered designs. “The solution is human-centered design (HCD), an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving.”9. The six fundamental principles of interaction: affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, feedback, and the conceptual model of the system. These principles are discussed with many examples to help the reader understand these important concepts. “Good conceptual models are the key to understandable, enjoyable products: good communication is the key to good conceptual models.”10. Helpful insights on how people use products; and the seven stages of action. “When people use something, they face two gulfs: the Gulf of Execution, where they try to figure out how it operates, and the Gulf of Evaluation, where they try to figure out what happened.”11. One of the strengths of this book is the very important but often times ignored aspect of psychology in design. “The approach I use here comes from my book Emotional Design. There, I suggested that a useful approximate model of human cognition and emotion is to consider three levels of processing: visceral, behavioral, and reflective.” “All three levels of processing work together. All play essential roles in determining a person’s like or dislike of a product or service.”12. A key premise of this book, “…in my experience, human error usually is a result of poor design: it should be called system error.” “The hard and necessary part of design is to make things work well even when things do not go as planned.”13. A chapter dedicated to how knowledge of the world combines with the knowledge in the head. “The design implications are clear: provide meaningful structures. Perhaps a better way is to make memory unnecessary: put the required information in the world. This is the power of the traditional graphical user interface with its old-fashioned menu structure.”14. An excellent chapter on how designers can provide the critical information that allows people to know what to do, even when experiencing an unfamiliar device or situation. The four kinds of constraints: physical, cultural, semantic, and logical.15. Insights on how to deal with failures. “Interruptions are a common reason for error, not helped by designs and procedures that assume full, dedicated attention yet that do not make it easy to resume operations after an interruption. And finally, perhaps the worst culprit of all, is the attitude of people toward errors.”16. Type of errors, the difference between mistakes and errors. “Slips occur when the goal is correct, but the required actions are not done properly: the execution is flawed. Mistakes occur when the goal or plan is wrong.” “What is a designer to do? Provide as much guidance as possible to ensure that the current state of things is displayed in a coherent and easily interpreted format—ideally graphical.”17. A key tidbit on checklists. “It is always better to have two people do checklists together as a team: one to read the instruction, the other to execute it.”18. The key to success of resilient organizations, “A resilient organization treats safety as a core value, not a commodity that can be counted.”19. Many great examples of sound design thinking. The Human-Centered Design Process. “There is no substitute for direct observation of and interaction with the people who will be using the product.”20. A real-world practice that resonates, “In product development, schedule and cost provide very strong constraints, so it is up to the design team to meet these requirements while getting to an acceptable, high-quality design.”21. Notes, references, and so much more…Negatives:1. I would have liked to have seen more examples of product failure. Perhaps, legal matters interfere with authors’ ability to share such information.2. More illustrations would have been helpful.3. For those of us in the field, appendices that provide more detailed information would have added value.4. The kindle did not take advantage of its linking capability. In other words, the notes provided were not linked.In summary, this was a very informative and enjoyable book to read. Norman succeeds in providing readers of all backgrounds with helpful insights on what constitutes good design in everyday products. A highly recommended read!Further recommendations: “Emotional Design” by the same author, “Inspired: How to Make Products Customers Love” by Marty Cagan, “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” by Nir Eyal, “100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People” by Susan Weinschenk, “Lean Customer Development: Building Products Your Customers Will Buy” by Cindy Alvarez, “Principles of Product Development Flow” by Donald G.

- **内容**: Endlich ein Buch, das mir Bestätigung gibt! Ob es Türen sind, die man falsch bedient, Öfen, Kugelschreiber, Smartphones oder Flugzeuge: Eigentlich lässt sich immer ein Problem auch beim Design finden und nicht nur bei dem Menschen, der Probleme hat. Norman hatte schon vor 25 Jahren genug Erfahrung, um ein erfolgreiches Buch zu schreiben, und jetzt hat er sie wohl erst recht. Hin und wieder erwähnt er, wie er für BMW und Apple gearbeitet hat und wie erfolgreich er war, was zu Beginn etwas prahlerisch wirkt, später aber verstehen lässt dass dieser Mann wirklich weiß, wovon er schreibt.Dabei erklärt Don Norman nicht nur, wie Dinge grundsätzlich gestaltet werden sollten, sondern auch, wie wir Menschen Dinge wahrnehmen, wie wir uns an Dinge erinnern, wie wir Fehler machen und wie wir daraus lernen. Dazu gibt er uns einige Methoden und Schlüsselbegriffe an die Hand, die fundamental wichtig sind. So sollte man unterscheiden zwischen den Dingen, die wir natürlicherweise mit einem Gegenstand tun können und Dingen, an denen wir sehen können, was wir tatsächlich mit einem Gegenstand machen sollen.Immer wieder gibt er dabei Beispiele aus der Weltgeschichte zu teils tragischen Unglücken oder lustigen Erlebnissen. So mussten sich zum Beispiel erst viele Menschen vor Panik selbst die Fluchtwege versperren, bevor ein Gesetz erlassen wurde, nach dem Türen in öffentlichen Gebäuden grundsätzlich in Richtung der Fluchtwege geöffnet werden müssen.In den letzten Kapiteln reflektiert Norman die Wichtigkeit von gutem Design allerdings noch einmal und gibt zu verstehen, warum gutes Design nicht immer umgesetzt werden kann, auch wenn man es sich vorstellen kann. Beispielsweise spielen schließlich Geld und Zeit auch immer eine Rolle.Eigentlich wollte ich das Buch erst kaufen, wenn ich schon studiere, aber selbst wenn ich nicht studieren sollte, war es das auf jeden Fall wert. Ich denke, selbst für Menschen, die beruflich gar nichts mit Design zu tun haben, ist das Buch interessant.Für diejenigen, die lieber Videos schauen, gibt es einige auf Youtube unter folgendem Link: [...] oder wenn ihr nach "The Design of Everyday Things" sucht.
