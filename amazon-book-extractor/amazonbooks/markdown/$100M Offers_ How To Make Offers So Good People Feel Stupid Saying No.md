| 内容简介 | ** OVER 300,000 COPIES SOLD!! **Number 1 Amazon BEST SELLER over the last 74 weeks!I took home more in a year than the CEOs of McDonalds, IKEA, Ford, Motorola, and Yahoo....combined....as a kid in my twenties....using the $100M Offer method. It works. And it will work for you.Not that long ago though, my business had gotten so bad that I literally couldn't even give my services away for free. At the end of each month, I would look at my bank account hoping to see progress (but there wasn't). I knew something had to change...but what?Over the next 48 months, I went from losing money to making $36 for every $1 spent. In that time period, we generated over $120,000,000 across four different industries: service, e-commerce, software, and brick & mortar.But, unlike everyone else, we didn't have great funnels, great ads, or a wealthy niche. In fact, we didn't even send emails until we had crossed $50M in sales(!). Instead, we were able to do this one thing really well....we created offers so good, people felt stupid saying no.Here's exactly what this book will show you how to do: How To Charge a Lot More Than You Currently Are...a- The Tiny Market Big Money Process we use to laser focus on niche markets overflowing with cashb- The "Unfair" Pricing formula....how we 100x'd our pricing (and got more people to say yes....for real)c- The Value Flip...so you never get price compared again (that's a promise)d- The Virtuous Cycle of Price...use it to outspend your competition (for good) while using your product to attract the best talent.How To Make Your Product So Good, Prospects Find A Way To Pay For Ita- The Unbeatable Value Equation....to make what you sell worth more than your prospects have ever receivedb- The Delivery Cube....to make delivering your products and services cost less but provide morec- The Trim & Stack Hack....to maximize profit using the absolute best delivery methods. (This has never been shared publicly and was how we made $17M in profit on $28M in revenue in a year when I was 28 years old).How To Enhance Your Offer So Much, Prospects Buy Without Hesitatinga- The Scarcity Stack....how to use the three different types of scarcity in every offer you make (without lying) to get people to buy the moment you askb- The "Everyday" Urgency Blueprint... to get prospects to buy RIGHT NOW, using everyday life to create real, ethical time pressurec- Unbeatable Bonuses...and watch your prospects' hesitations melt away as they begin reading their credit cards to you before you even finish!d- God-mode Guarantees...so good they make anyone say yes (even people who would never normally consider buying). I'll show you how to stack and layer all 4 types of guarantees together. I even give you my 13 favorite guarantees word-for-word to swipe for yourself.e- Magic Naming Formula to get the absolute highest response rates and conversion rates from everything you do to get new clients and so much more...The methods contained within this book are so simple, so instantaneous, and so effective, it's as if they work by magic. If you implement even one tactic in this book, you'll see the change in your prospects' demeanor. And you'll know the $100M Offer method worked when you start hearing "What do I need to do to move forward?" ...before you even ask for the sale. |

I was struggling to finalise my service.
- **日期**: Reviewed in Japan on December 16, 2024
- **内容**: I picked up this book because I was struggling to price my services and create irresistible offers after I finished reading "Building a story brand" by Donald Miller and it feels like this was exactly what I needed. It’s going to change my business and maybe even my life!I’m so glad I read this book early in my entrepreneurial journey. Back when I majored in business at university, not a single professor ever shared anything remotely as practical or actionable as what’s in this book. Honestly, I feel like I wasted four years, lol! If I could go back, I’d read $100M Offers ten times instead of taking those courses.Now I clearly see the issues holding my business back and exactly how to fix them. I’m excited to create offers that truly provide value and resonate with my clients. Huge thanks to Alex for writing this masterpiece—I’ve already bought $100M Leads, and I can’t wait to dive into that next!If you’re a business owner, do yourself a favour and read this book. It’s absolutely worth it!

It’s easy to understand, the language is like Alex is talking to you (if you have ever heard him you will hear his bounce in your head), the size of a text book makes the reading experience very didactic and easy to take notes.

- **标题**: A Game-Changing Guide for Creating Irresistible Business Offers
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025
- **内容**: Even though I'm only halfway through "$100M Offers," I can confidently say this book is a game-changer for anyone serious about growing their business. Hormozi doesn't just rehash generic business advice – he provides a concrete, actionable framework for creating offers that genuinely stand out in today's crowded marketplace.What sets this book apart is Hormozi's ability to break down complex business concepts into digestible, implementable steps. His "Grand Slam Offer" framework isn't just theory; it's a proven system backed by real-world results from his own business ventures and those of his clients.The writing style is refreshingly direct and engaging. Hormozi cuts through the fluff and delivers pure value, just as he teaches readers to do with their own offers. His examples are relevant and applicable across various industries, making the book valuable whether you're running a service business, selling products, or just starting your entrepreneurial journey.Particularly impressive is how the book addresses both the strategic and psychological aspects of offer creation. Hormozi doesn't just tell you what to do; he explains the underlying principles of value perception and customer psychology that make certain offers irresistible.Some key strengths of the book:- Clear, actionable steps rather than vague concepts- Real-world examples that illustrate each principle- Practical frameworks you can implement immediately- No-nonsense approach to value creation and pricing- Deep insights into customer psychology and decision-makingWhile I haven't finished the book yet, the principles I've learned and implemented so far have already begun to transform how I think about my business offerings. This isn't just another business book – it's a practical manual for anyone serious about creating high-value offers that stand out in the market.Highly recommended for entrepreneurs, business owners, and anyone involved in sales or marketing who wants to learn how to craft truly compelling offers that customers find hard to refuse.
