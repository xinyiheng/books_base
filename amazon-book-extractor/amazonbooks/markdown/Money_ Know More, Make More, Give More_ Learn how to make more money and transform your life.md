| 内容简介 | Do you want to get to the stage - soon - where you are truly financially independent, able to use your money in the way you'd like, and be completely confident in your ability to take care of yourself and your family? That is a universal desire, but many of us regard wealth and financial independence as a goal which we'll likely never achieve - there are just too many bills that need paying and there is a widespread belief that the money game is rigged. Even people who win the lottery or inherit money often seem to wind up losing it. The evidence suggests you can't win a game that you don't understand - even if you start out winning - because you never understood the game in the first place.So how can you win with money? How can you create independent wealth and hold on to it? This inspiring book by self-made multi-millionaire Rob Moore explains the rules of the game, shares simple tricks for managing money better, details how to create a plan for an ambitious future, and shows you the very best way to become a millionaire - to think and behave like one! |

This is an exceptionally good book, really
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 June 2018
- **内容**: I'd never heard of Rob Moore prior to reading Money - Know More, Make More, Give More. The book came up as recommended by Amazon based on something I'd recently bought.  Since initially buying the Audible book in April 2018, I've purchased three paperbacks for friends/family and one for myself. And I've re-listened to the Audible book.  Rob's book has been nothing short of transformative for me and my husband.Husband - PhD in Economics from a top Uni.  After his family experienced difficult money problems when my husband was a teenager, his relationship with money has always been complex.  He's made a lot, but never enough to assure him that he didn't have to worry.  He felt guilty when he had extra yet was hesitant to give any away (including to charities, as tips, etc.)  Let's just say he always managed his money VERY carefully, but still was never happy/relaxed that he was in a good place, despite saving an impressive amount.Me - since age 13 when I started babysitting, then waiting on tables to earn money through Uni, I've always had a "spend it while you have it" attitude.  Apart from a sizeable private pension that (thankfully) my mum urged me to invest in in my early 20s, I've never saved a penny.In 15 years of marriage, we've had our share of spats and disputes - no more or less than the average couple, I think.  And the one thing at the root of every single one of these disagreements - money.  Looking back through the years, I'm sure each of us felt like we were "right".  Husband trying to keep the money in the bank, invest wisely for a rainy day and me trying to "live for the moment" and be over generous with charities and homeless people and stray cats... (you name it) while severely undercharging for my consulting services and not bringing in my share of the income.This book has given us so much.  It offers a stunning combination of history money and wealth, mechanics of money and the philosophy/psychology of poverty vs. wealth.  It has pointed out that both of us have so much to learn about money.  As Rob points out, learning to make a lot of money is a bit like learning to play golf, or a piano.. or to do anything that requires skill;  learn from the people you respect the most, take risks and practice.  But more fundamental than that, Rob urges the reader to understand his/her purpose in life; what do you have to offer that makes you unique in the world and that few, if any, could do better.  And then he asks us to master that skill and charge what we're worth, and no less!  "Fair Exchange" is a concept that Rob uses throughout the book in his urging to get people to stop underselling themselves.But the book is so much more than that.  It really offers a complete set of practical knowledge paired with ideas and tools to support wealth creation. Whether you want to tweak an already good relationship with money or whether you need an entire overhaul, this book has content that will have you considering and reconsidering how you see money.This book has fundamentally changed both me and my husband as individuals.  It offers a common vocabulary for us to share when we talk about how we've hindered ourselves (and our marriage) in the past through our ignorance of money matters.  Both of us have made dramatic changes in how we view and treat money - moving us each toward a healthy middle ground. Since reading this book two months ago, we have not had a single argument. Not one.  It's like this book has equipped us with a new lens with which to view everything - projects, investments, bank accounts, whether to tip a waiter, everything.  We are super excited as we apply Rob's concepts to our personal and business affairs.  So far, very good!!I'm only hoping that Rob soon decides to write a verison of this book for parents to help bring some of these concepts into raising the next generation.  And I hope he gets involved in a charity/cause to see that teenagers and young adults receive some of this guidance in school.  So many lives would be dramatically improved if we could instil healthy money views and habits in people early in life.

Excellent introduction, using accessible language and sector specific terminology
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2017
- **内容**: I bought 5 books, kept 2 for me, one to scribble on and one to just read. I have one to my eldest daughter for her 22nd birthday, hoping she’d read it, I have 2 to give to friends who are at stage they need to challenge their belief systems about work and money..Excellent introduction, using accessible language and sector specific terminology, from a book that enables newbies such as me into a new chosen path see the term, noun and outcome of  ‘Money’in different light to how I’d viewed it before.  It’s an excellent tool to help with paradigm shift, as you reconsider and review  that Einstein saying. ‘If you’ve always done what you’ve always done, it’s madness to expect something different to happen..’.  so it’s a great resource to help shift you out of a comfort zone and mindset you are not happily in.  Ideas and suggested actions really reinforced ideas from previous books I am still reading that Rob has written and also really hit the aspect and traditional embedded belief systems of working hard for others in relation to working hard for and with yourself, but also in relation to helping others.. as you can go back to it time and time again if you have that tendency to waiver from your evolving plan and ideas you develop when reading the book. This book provides an excellent example of a role model to seriously consider when moving forward with your chosen path at whatever level you choose., as well as enabling your children to see what they may see as they grow and develop.I secrete myself away and read this book when I make the time to do so.  Like doing physical exercise, teading and learning from this book is mental exercise as my angel dancers in my brain consistently fire as I always learn something new. However, my brain can only absorb so much, so each time I read, I start by re reading a little of what I read before, always seeing and learning something new and no matter where I start each new time.I liked the intro, very engaging .. that of reading Robs life history and how his past life, experiences, the people he met and beliefs impacted on who’s future choices he made. Finally, this book does give hope, making you realise there is another way, to achieving what you want to, but if you’re expecting to do it... with no effort on your part...it’s highly unlikely this will happen, because you need to challenge yourself, take action, not give up and work with others to start the process of living your dream.. after all you are responsible for your choices you make..would have liked writing to be a bit bigger, as makes for easier reading. . However, this £10 investment goes a long way to help you umderstand the potential of what you could do...

Topics were property, money and business in general. I chose to fly in from Germany every single time because Rob delivers amazing value. I have been to at least 2 money maker summit events where Rob allowed to share part of his book content. From this I can tell what to expect from this book though I have not finished reading this book ... it will be ONE LIKE NO OTHER ... as Rob is himself ... 🙏❤️😊
