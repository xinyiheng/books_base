His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined.

      "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nIt's a book and I love books. From the start I could see that ...",
      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2017",
      "content": "Everyone has talked about this book, from Madonna, Pharrell, and Oprah, to my mother. \"Life-changing\" is what I heard.As a reader, I couldn't resist. It's a book and I love books.From the start I could see that this would be a book I could sink my teeth into. I started out strong, but I kept getting distracted by...everything. The phone, the television, kids, my husband, you name it.Days went by and I hadn't gotten past the third chapter of this very short book that I wanted so desperately to read. Then it hit me! Download the audiobook.I began listening to The Alchemist during my long car rides throughout the city. I feasted on Santiago's journey for two days until the very end. What did I learn? Was it as life-changing as I'd expected it to be?For starters, the book was narrated by Jeremy Irons who did an amazing job! They could not have picked a better person. His voice enriched the life of Santiago.The take away—it didn't change me, per se. I'm not ready to get off the path I'm already on. However, it did reinvigorate my belief in dreams. Hell, I've been a dreamer my whole life. And what do all dreamers know? It's hard, so hard to stay on the path to your dreams until you realize them.Just like Santiago, I have been knocked around by life. I have thought many times, Why write? Why not just continue working as an occupational therapist until retirement? Wouldn't that make life easier?Santiago also considered ditching his plans to seek his treasure to live out his life as a shepherd or work at a crystal shop until some ripe old age.How long is too long to stay on the path to your dreams?I began writing at the age of six. I would have my mom or one of my grandparents cut paper in half for me, and then staple the pages together. Then I would write stories about ants, bugs, and animal adventures in my first grade penmanship. When I turned nine, my mother bought me a thesaurus, a dictionary, and a typewriter. Not dolls or games. What nine year-old gets a typewriter for her birthday?Best gift, ever!In middle school I made up wild and ridiculously fun stories with me as the lead. It was a way of escaping my reality during those tough years. In high school, I began writing scripts. I loved script writing so much, I sent scripts in to NBC at the age of sixteen!When I turned 18 I gave up on my dreams to be \"an adult\". I listened to voices that were not my own. After college, I concentrated on marriage and kids. I was happy, but something was missing.In 2004, my passion came back to me. I started having the best dreams and I began writing them down. In 2005, I completed my first book! Did it become a bestseller? Nope.By 2007, I was taking a screenwriting class. I was like a teenager again. I took to it with renewed zeal. Without fear I sought representation for my scripts. Sent them to Disney. Did I make a movie? Sell a script? Nope.Fast-forward to 2017, now thirteen years on this path to achieve my dreams! And I have! Well, parts of it. I have indie-published four books, and a fifth one is on the way. I have a growing fan base! Wonderful ladies write to me or post on my social media pages that they love my series and my writing!! It feels amazing to read, and I always try to respond.Did I ever quit? Nope.Why, in the middle of this review did I share my own story with you? Because, I am Santiago. We all are. We are all born with talents and dreams! Every child has a desire and dream of what they want to be. Most of us give dreams up to become \"adults\". But why? Why can't we be that person? After all, childhood is the most raw, honest, innocent, unbiased time of our life! Who better to pick our destinies then our child selves?\"Little D.W.\" chose my career—a writer. It has been a source of happiness, escape, creativity, passion, and love for me.I still have one foot in the rat race. Imagine how crazy I look right now, running in both directions! But I am Santiago, my treasure is so close that I can smell it, feel it, taste it! I am ready to jump out of the rat race with feet and run at full speed toward my dream.I am Santiago. You are Santiago! Do yourself a favor and pick up this book, it's short and sweet, yet packed with power. You may be a dreamer now or may have been a dreamer once upon a time. Whichever it is, if you are still in the rat race running toward nowhere, I recommend this book to get you back on track. Your treasure, whatever it is for you, is out there waiting for you to go after it!\nRead more",

      "title": "5.0 out of 5 stars\nOne Of The Most Important Books Ever Written",
      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2017",
      "content": "The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is in my opinion, one of the most important books ever written. It's no wonder that it's  one of the best-selling books of all time with more than 150 million copies sold. Those numbers are in spite of and defiance to the author's encouragement to file share his now legendary novel.But sales statistics are not the criterion on which I stake this claim. It is the impact on the lives of those that have read it, and the impact on the lives that have not yet been born, that I boldly state the above.The simplicity of its unfoldment may at first belie the depth of its wisdom. But the simplicity is part of the profundity that allows the reader to assimilate the messages without resistance.The first time I read The Alchemist;, I read it cover to cover in one sitting. No bathroom break, no cup of water pause, no telephone distractions. I read it from the first word to the last in what seemed like a single breath.I simply couldn't put it down.I was swept, swung, and swallowed up by this extraordinary narrative. The result was transformation. I was not the same man that began reading the novel by the time I finished it.I would thereafter read it again and again. The messages are so layered that with every new pass comes new understanding and enlightenment.At the core of the novel is the fulfillment of one’s destiny. There is a force in the Soul of the World that wants us all to live out our personal legend. When we truly desire something, the entire Universe conspires to help us achieve it. With love, all things are possible. With love, we can perform miracles.These themes are artfully integrated and clothed within a modern day fable. They come in varying iterations from a string of colorful characters that propel the protagonist towards a profound and satisfying ending.The Alchemist is the story of Santiago, a shepherd boy from Spain that crosses the desert of Africa in search of a hidden treasure. It was revealed to him in a reoccurring dream that the treasure is buried by the Ancient Pyramids in Egypt.What he naively believes will take three weeks to complete becomes a journey that expands nearly three years. After miles of traveling through the desert, the boy arrives at an oasis where he falls in love with a beautiful desert woman named Fatima. The boy is willing to abandon his dream of finding his treasure for the procurement of her love.But one night, beneath the light of a full moon, he meets a man straddled upon a mighty horse. This elusive man is known in legend and folklore as The Alchemist.The Alchemist is a man imbued with profound wisdom and mystical powers. He is reportedly over 300-years-old and can turn lead into gold.He reminds the boy that his destiny is to find the treasure. That he must continue. If it is true love, Fatima will be waiting for him after his destiny is fulfilled.Reluctantly, the boy continues his journey deeper into the desert accompanied by The Alchemist. But the desert is at war, and they are soon captured by Bedouin sentinels and accused of spying for the enemy.For this crime, they are sentenced to death.The Alchemist saves them temporarily by proclaiming that the boy is an Alchemist. He tells the general that if he wanted to, the boy could turn himself into the wind and destroy their entire camp. The general is intrigued! He wants to see this happen. He promises to spare their lives if it is done. He grants them three days.But how does a shepherd boy from Spain turn himself into the wind?Paulo Coelho says that he wrote “The Alchemist” in two weeks. It is almost hard to imagine that something so far-reaching could have been conjured up in two weeks time. He said it was his own journey that he was writing down, parabolically speaking.The impact of “The Alchemist” comes from the realization that Santiago’s journey is Everyman’s journey. His story is our story. If we tap into the Soul of the World and dare to live out our destiny, we will discover that within us all is The Alchemist.\nRead more",

      "date": "Reviewed in Canada on February 5, 2025",
      "content": "Few books capture human longing, destiny, and spiritual awakening as beautifully as The Alchemist. Paulo Coelho’s tale of Santiago, a young shepherd seeking treasure, unfolds as a journey of self-discovery. He learns that true wealth lies not in gold but in understanding the language of the universe and following his heart.Coelho’s poetic simplicity distills deep wisdom into a fable that resonates across time. The novel’s aphorisms—like “When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you”—have inspired millions. Each character Santiago meets reflects different stages of personal growth, reinforcing the importance of trust, perseverance, and inner guidance.A masterpiece of universal appeal, The Alchemist remains a spiritual companion rather than just a novel. Its magic evolves with the reader, offering fresh insights at every stage of life. A timeless reminder to pursue our dreams, it never ceases to enthrall.\nRead more",
