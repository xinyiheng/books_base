- **内容**: As someone who deals with social anxiety, I'm currently in the phase of pushing myself to socialize more to "get better". This book is very helpful and informative in taking those first steps as well as what comes after. I've been lucky enough to have had the opportunity to apply some of what I learned in real life. I stumbled a bit but I think overall it turned out okay. So all in all, it was a great read and actually useful. 10/10 recommend. Hope you enjoy and good luck out there fellow introverts!🙃
