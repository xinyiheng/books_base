| 内容简介 | Buffett's Early Investments investigates ten investments that legendary investor Warren Buffett made in the 1950s and 1960s – earning him his first millions – and uncovers unique insights in the process.Using the same documents Buffett used when he made these investments, the author reveals the fascinating inside stories of:- How Philadelphia and Reading, Buffett’s largest investment in 1954, transformed from a declining coal company to a diversified conglomerate whose stock went up twentyfold due to the intervention of Buffett’s mentor, Ben Graham.- How Buffett and Charlie Munger made their first formal investment together in Hochschild-Kohn.- How corporate governance issues actually presented serious risk to Buffett’s 1966 investment in Walt Disney.Other investments analyzed include American Express, British Columbia Power, Cleveland Worsted Mills, Greif Bros, Marshall-Wells, Studebaker, and Union Street Railway. Not all of these investments worked out―this book shows why.Buffett’s Early Investments helps readers understand how history’s greatest ever investor really made his returns in the years where he produced his best numbers. |

Detail not found in any other book on Buffett
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024
- **内容**: "It adds so much color to the investment partnerships beyond the typical Buffett-isms you see online.Adding context to every investment, the story behind it, how Buffett maneuvered, and the raw business numbers itself is tremendously helpful.My favorite is the Columbia Power one. Everyone is aware of Munger leveraging 100% of his fund on it. But the legal maneuvers around it and the business numbers themselves are things that very few people know about. This book presents those very important facts at every chapter.I’m adding this as one of the top 5 Buffett books. And I say that as someone who has owned and read almost all of them."

A Must-Read for Value Investors and Fans of Hands-On, Gumshoe Research
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024
- **内容**: Wow, what a gem! Brett Gardner’s Buffett's Early Investments is a total must-read for anyone who’s even a little curious about how Warren Buffett became, well, Warren Buffett. This book dives into his early investing years in the 1950s and 1960s, and let me tell you—it’s packed with insight, stories, and “aha!” moments that make it hard to put down. If you’re building an investing bookshelf, this one’s got to be on it.What really stood out to me were the case studies. Gardner breaks down several of Buffett’s key investments, including what is arguably the most consequential one: Philadelphia and Reading. It’s clear just how much original research Buffett poured into every decision. Gardner doesn’t just talk about it—he actually walks through us the same documents Buffett used. It’s like you’re sitting in his office, watching him work through the numbers. Very nice.Another thing that was evident was Buffett’s gutsy strategy of concentrating his bets. Imagine putting 40% of your portfolio into one idea, like American Express! It’s wild, but Gardner lays out how (and why) Buffett’s confidence and careful research made it work.And then there’s the activist side of Buffett. This was an area that I was very familiar with given what Buffett wrote about in his past Partnership Letters.  Gardner underscores that Buffett wasn’t just buying stocks; he was nudging companies to do better—reallocating capital, chatting up management, and even sending people to annual meetings to gather intel. Gardner paints a picture of a young Buffett hustling like crazy, driving across the country to meet management teams. It’s like a detective story, but with stocks.I also loved the historical context. People love to say investing was “easier” back in the day, but this book totally debunks that. Buffett worked his tail off to dig up opportunities, and Gardner makes that crystal clear.Honestly, I can’t say enough good things. Gardner nailed it. This book reminds me of a bygone era of investing and shows why good gumshoe fundamental research will always be relevant in today’s world of index funds. If you’re an investor or just love a good story about grit and smarts, this book is for you.Well done, Brett. Well done.

Brett Gardner takes you into the trenches with a young Warren Buffet.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2024
- **内容**: This book is a great addition to the Pantheon of "Buffetology" books. All the other books focus largely on the Berkshire Hathaway phase of Warren Buffet's career. This book focusses exclusively on the early Buffet years with deep dives into his actual investments. Surprisingly the vast majority of investments were cigar butts, secular declining business, restructuring plays and arbitrage situations. This was his bread and butter. None of these were the multibaggers for which he is now renowned. Buffet himself says "quantitative value is more reliable since it needs no insights although returns are more limited, on the other hand qualitative value produces higher returns but is rare since it requires unique insights". So the early phase of his career where he produced his highest returns was dominated by traditional low multiple value stocks. In this early phase he reliably hit singles. Today he is identified with "few swings" and only home runs in the public's imagination. This is erroneous. You need to read this book to complete and deepen your understanding of Buffet's career. Brett has done deep research that brings to life these stock investments which were shrouded in the mists of time. The investment picture is comprehensive with industry perspective, macro data and all financial metrics. Brett has produced the best book on "Buffet's investments". And what better way to understand Buffet than to understand his investments?

Get to know a side of Buffett you never hear about
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2025
- **内容**: This book explores a side of Mr. Buffett not addressed in other works. You always read that Mr. Buffett sits in his office the entire day and reads. He may read a great deal but this excellent book will disabuse of the notion that this is all that he does. A unique book and look at how Buffett really operates. Strongly recommended.

Great history of Buffett’s journey as an investor
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2024
- **内容**: Meticulously researched and thought through. I’m grateful that Brett took the pains to read archives and talk to people to uncover Buffett’s early investments. Additionally, Brett went through the investment thesis with explanations on the industry context, company’s operating numbers, and outcomes.More important investments are covered more thoroughly, eg Disney and Amex, than less important ones. Brett showed the same cases covered in Snowball in a different light, providing new insights. And, unfortunately, the book could benefit with a bit more context on the earlier chapters that would help the reader to understand the industry dynamics better.The book helped me understand what differentiates great from good in investing.

Interesting but not worth the price
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2025
- **内容**: Interesting work, but if you take out all the pictures, tables, and graphs, it is a really short work. More like a pamphlet than a book. The $45 MSRP is exorbitant for this book…
