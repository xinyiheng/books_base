‘There’s always professional reincarnation if you’re unhappy in your job’ – Sound advice
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2022
- **内容**: California author Jotham S Stein earned his degrees from Princeton University and from Stanford Law School and has law practice credentials in multiple states in addition to the United States Supreme Court, several United States Courts of Appeals, and District Courts. He has served as a part-time General Counsel of a high tech Silicon Valley company as well as being principal of his Law Offices in California and Illinois. His books to date – EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT LAW: PROTECTING EXECUTIVES, ENTREPRENEURS AND EMPLOYEES and now NEGOTIATE LIKE A CEO.One of the many reasons Stein’s book is so valuable and a pleasure to read is his manner of discourse – relaxed, witty, and relatable. ‘CEOs get fired all the time! CEOs get fired for all sorts of reasons, both economically rational and irrational. Many get fired for legal reasons, but not always. Some get fired for doing a bad job. Others get fired because someone didn’t like them, even though they were doing a great job. Still others get fired for financial, sexual or other wrongdoing. Founders aren’t immune, not by a long stretch, or any stretch for that matter. Entrepreneurs are regularly forced out, squeezed out and fired from companies they birthed, sometimes to watch painfully from afar as others make millions while they earn little.’ And given that spectrum, Stein has written the ultimate guide to talking money, an essential tool for anyone moving up in business.With Stein’s extraordinary experience practicing law, especially as applied to entrepreneurs, executives, managers and regular employees, it is obvious that he is master of proffering advice. As he relate, ‘Brutally honest is the way I practice law. It is also the way I wrote this book. Direct and to the point.’ And getting to the point of making his expertise available to all, he shares ‘how top entrepreneurs and executives protect themselves and how you can, too!’ ‘If you’re a regular employee, you’ll learn to be aware, to recognize potential employment pitfalls, and how to protect yourself if you’re able to do so. You’ll also learn that you may have more leverage than you might think, either now or as you advance in your career.’Maintaining a jocular and supportive tone, each chapter focuses on a particular issue, mixing straightforward actionable advice with engaging fictional stories, based on real-life scenarios. No matter the level of ‘employment ‘– bottom to top – this book is an invaluable and accessible guide on how to succeed in business – and life! Very highly recommended. Grady Harp, February 22

Everyone needs a copy of this book!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2022
- **内容**: Jotham S. Stein is a brilliant and extremely knowledgeable expert when it comes to business practices and business law. His bio is so impressive, diverse, and accomplished as it lists an extensive lists of courts he practices in, types of clients, professional experience, and accolades. He is the man you want to write the book on how to protect your family, friends, and self in the dog eat world of business. And thankfully he has written the book, with his second book entitled Negotiate Like a CEO: How to Get Ahead with Lessons Learned From Top Entrepreneurs and Executives.I love this book for so many reason. One of which is Stein's writing style. It is written in a very approachable, even witty, straight forward yet detailed and understandable way. He introduces a lot of lawyer/business lingo, but always explains. He doesn’t belabor points or diverge down small caveats and distracting details. However, his writing is a perfect balance of thorough and approachable.I also love that he writes for such a huge audience. He really has important knowledge to share with people all over the business and contract world. He reaches to the top CEOs and the low man on the pole. He doesn’t just cover huge business contracts and the most elite, he also covers topics and more relatable information for situations that everyone will find themselves in at some point. Our world functions on contracts and Stein takes the time and expert knowledge he has to break it all down and teach us how to be confident in our knowledge so we can then be bold and courageous in our lives when it comes these situations.Also, I loved the format he has set up to explain and teach. He uses fictional situations that are based on real life scenarios to help the reader understand the information as well as apply it when necessary. Most people learn through examples and the situations and short vignettes he uses is the perfect tool to make this information accessible and understandable for everyone regardless of their previous knowledge or background. Also, the end of each chapter is studded with key points and specific tips to help the reader remember the main ideas.I am so glad I picked up this book and think everyone needs a copy on their bookshelf or kindle, regardless of their line of work or station in life. The knowledge and confidence this book imparts is priceless.
