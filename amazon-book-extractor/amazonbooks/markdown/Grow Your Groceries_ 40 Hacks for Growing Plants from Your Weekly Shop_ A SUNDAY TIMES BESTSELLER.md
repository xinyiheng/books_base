Great user & pocket friendly book!

- **内容**: Arrived yesterday & love this book already! it’s so easy to follow and it genuinely uses stuff you’d have in the house all the time.. there is no fancy purchases required which is a massive plus, I love to potter around in the garden vs orchestrate big plans - I reckon I can pick a page and go plant whatever it says with little to no planning required - there’s a 90% chance I’ll have what I need to hand to make it work. It’s the definition of user & pocket friendly! Great book

Great purchase
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 March 2025
- **内容**: Love this book. Just the right size to fit into my gardening coat pocket. Full of great ideas and coloured photos. Concise, practical and straight to the point. I’m not a knowledgeable gardener (I didn’t take the time to spend gardening hours listening to my grandparents and parents as they worked) but I love having a go at it so any knowledge I can now gain is wonderful. I thoroughly recommend this book.
