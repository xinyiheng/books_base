| 作者简介 | Earl Nightingale grew up in California during the Great Depression. Because his family was very poor, Earl educated himself in his local library. His main focus: what makes people turn out the way they do in terms of their wealth, their career achievements, and their happiness.  After beginning his career in the US Marines during World War II, Earl was hired as a radio announcer. He eventually became a popular daily broadcaster for CBS. Through his interest in both personal development and audio, he partnered with Lloyd Conant to form the Nightingale Conant Corporation. At Nightingale Conant, he focused on recording the ideas and lessons about success that he studied throughout his life. |

In this easy-to-read compilation from his old radio shows, Nightingale, the legendary voice behind The Strangest Secret, shares timeless wisdom and practical strategies that have empowered countless individuals to achieve financial independence and security.
