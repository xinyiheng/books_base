| 内容简介 | PULITZER PRIZE FINALIST • Benjamin Franklin, perhaps the pivotal figure in colonial and revolutionary America, comes vividly to life in this “thorough biography of ... America’s first Renaissance man” (The Washington Post) by the two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist, bestselling historian, and author of Our First Civil War."The authoritative Franklin biography for our time.” —Joseph J. Ellis, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Founding BrothersWit, diplomat, scientist, philosopher, businessman, inventor, and bon vivant, Benjamin Franklin's "life is one every American should know well, and it has not been told better than by Mr. Brands" (The Dallas Morning News). From penniless runaway to highly successful printer, from ardently loyal subject of Britain to architect of an alliance with France that ensured America’s independence, Franklin went from obscurity to become one of the world’s most admired figures, whose circle included the likes of Voltaire, Hume, Burke, and Kant.Drawing on previously unpublished letters and a host of other sources, acclaimed historian H. W. Brands has written a thoroughly engaging biography of the eighteenth-century genius. A much needed reminder of Franklin’s greatness and humanity, The First Americanis a work of meticulous scholarship that provides a magnificent tour of a legendary historical figure, a vital era in American life, and the countless arenas in which the protean Franklin left his legacy.Look for H.W. Brands's other biographies: ANDREW JACKSON, THE MAN WHO SAVED THE UNION (Ulysses S. Grant), TRAITOR TO HIS CLASS (Franklin Roosevelt) and REAGAN. |

An in-depth look at America's founding (grand)father
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2013
- **内容**: I love studying American Revolutionary history.  The stories of the founding fathers, the course of the war for Independence, and the setting up of our nation are all topics that fascinate me tremendously.  I have a continuously growing library of books dedicated to this topic, but for the longest time I was missing anything related to the life of Benjamin Franklin. So I was very excited to discover this book and eager to begin reading it as soon as it arrived in the mail.What a treat this book is!  Clearly the author enjoyed researching the life of Benjamin Franklin for he is so incredibly thorough about nearly every possible aspect of this biography.  As a reader I got a remarkably clear picture of the evolution of Benjamin Franklin's character throughout his life.  Drawing from Franklin autobiography, innumerable letters he wrote to friends and colleges, and the insights of Franklin's contemporaries, I could not help but be impressed by the depth of primary source documentation that was presented here.  It must've taken years for the author to find all this information and then even longer to organize it all into this wonderful and throughly readable book.Benjamin Franklin led an amazingly fascinating life.  His mind never stops turning, his pen never stopped writing, and the world never stopped becoming better for it all. He was loved the world over, admired for his many scientific and diplomatic achievements, and successful in nearly everything he did.  But I had no idea that he did so much! Presented here are stories ranging all the way back to the youth of this great man and all the way up to just before his death.  And it seems like the man never spent any time just being lazy. He was always moving. He was always exploring, discovering, and accomplishing.  In this book you see detailed Franklin's hard work ethic and the many accomplishments that that work ethic brought him along with great respect from nearly everyone around him.  You see the enemies that Franklin's accomplishments generated, some being enemies out of mere jealousy and others out of political differences. And you see how Franklin dealt with those enemies with wisdom and wit.  You see Franklin's love of the ladies how he would playfully pursue them.  You see Franklin's reluctant entrance into politics and how greatly he would influence the politics of our young country once he finally entered the game.  But even more interestingly than all this you see how each and every one of these attitudes of Franklin's changed throughout the course of his life.  Every page is full of quotations and evidence from primary sources! It is like a treasure chest of historical voices right at your fingertips.  And all the fun little stories that the author throws into his writing concerning different episodes in Franklin's life are precious.  By the time you're done with this book you know Franklin. You know him very well.All in all this is a great book, very readable, lots of fun, with not a single boring section anywhere. Order it and get ready for real treat.

Revolutionary Renaissance Man
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2002
- **内容**: In the last 16 months there have been some heavy-hitters in the world of American political biography. Besides this book, the books by David McCullough and Edmund Morris, on John Adams and Theodore Roosevelt, respectively, come to mind. (I apologize if I am leaving out any other "biggies".) I have read all three of the above mentioned works and I have to say that I think the Brands book is the best of the bunch. That statement is not meant to demean the quality of the other two books. They are both wonderful books. But Brands has surpassed McCullough and Morris with this particular book.Why do I say this? There are several reasons. One reason is that Brands is equally good with narrative and analysis. His way with words is equal to the other two authors. High praise indeed, because if you look at the Morris book there is great writing on nearly every page. Brands has managed to accomplish this also. Regarding Benjamin Vaughan, who espoused the virtues of hemlock to Franklin as a treatment for Franklin's kidney stone, Brands writes that he had "suggested a sub-Socratic dose." Regarding Franklin's voyage from Boston to New York, as a teenager, where his foray into vegetarianism ran headlong into the smell of fresh cod being cooked on board: "Before his vegetarian days he, like most Bostonians, had loved fish: fried, steamed, boiled, stewed. The present smell conjured recollections of memorable meals past, and he decided to revisit the argument for interspecies pacifism. To his delight he discovered a loophole. 'I recollected that when the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish taken out of their stomachs; then I thought, if you eat one another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you.'" But besides writing well, when dealing with Franklin's political life the author is able to explain and analyze and make things clear for the lay reader. (As Brands is a professor of history he has the advantage of his teaching background in this regard.)Although the narrative was wonderful in the Morris book I found him a bit weak on political analysis. Likewise with McCullough. This could have something to do with their non-academic backgrounds. I also felt that McCullough went a bit overboard in his "Jefferson bashing", as though he felt he needed to build Adams up by tearing Jefferson down. Brands does very little "bashing" of anyone. He has a few comments towards the end of the book regarding Adams' jealousy of Franklin, but it doesn't turn into a diatribe.Brands has the good sense just to tell you about the remarkable life of Franklin. We all know about the kite and lightning rods but what about Franklin's invention of a musical instrument (the Armonica); his creation of a more efficient stove for heating (the Franklin stove); inventing what he called "double spectacles" or bifocals, as we know them; etc. When Franklin got to Philadelphia he started a public library and fire brigades; later on in life he speculated on scientific matters- the Gulf Stream and a geological theory that was admittedly very rudimentary and not developed- but that had elements of plate tectonics in it. Remarkable. Oh, and something else..... After observing some black children in an "experimental" school setting he came to the conclusion that  there were no intrinsic differences in the races. So, not only was he "anti-slavery" but he truly believed that with education all races would be equal. This was very radical thinking for the times....It is a major accomplishment that Mr. Brands managed to fit everything into this one volume, without skimping on any aspects of Franklin's life. A truly wonderful book.

Great Book About one of the United States' Most Important Citizens
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2025
- **内容**: Outstanding book about one of America's most (perhaps THE most) brilliant minds. Franklin definitely deserves a place among the other great intellectual figures of The Enlightenment.Kudos to the author for not writing a hagiography. As I learned from this book, Franklin was not a very moral person, but this does not change the fact that Franklin made numerous important contributions to the United States and the world. I highly recommend this book!

- **内容**: I take pride in knowing my history. I believe their is a saying that goes "one must first know the past in order to predict the future" something along those lines. I love historical literature, reading books about historical figures just makes me go bananas and this book did not let me down. It was very interesting, mind you it dragged on at times but its a biography so it comes with the territory but it was very worth while and I quite enjoyed it, would definitely read it again and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys informative history books.

- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on April 7, 2014
- **内容**: In: joaopaleta.comReading Benjamin Franklin’s Biography, “The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin by Brands, H.W.” (and by the way what a great reading, what a great story and what a great man) I came to realize that you cannot trust everything is told to you, everything you read or everything you see. You have to question it (the Why) and use your own judgement. To filter.Mr. Franklin was the Post Master for the colony (America) he had a printer shop (this is 18th Century), actually he had equity in several printer shops, he had royalties fees from all printings sold in all printer shops he was shareholder in, he sold raw materials to them and he was the main content producer. His goal? To sell (One example is his “Poor Richard’s Almanack” that was sold by the thousands between 1732 and 1758) and make money so he could build passive income enough which in turn would allow him to dedicate his time to his passions, including Science. He retired at the age of 42 and for another 40 years he managed to influence the course of American History. He was a (is) an inspiration, a producer of Good Content and developed an ingenious Business Model to make money out of it.Today you have billions of currency being made out of what is now called the self-help industry, books, audio-book, workshops, theories, techniques, etc. being sold worldwide. A lot of it is Bad Content. Do the authors really want to help you? Are they inspirational? or they just want to help themselves and make money? Big difference.I like Business. So for self-help with “Good Content”, with “Good Business Model” and that were highly influenced by Benjamin Franklin whom I admire, I recommend you:- “Dale Carnegie: How to Win Friends and Influence People” (1936)- “Stephen Covey: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People” (1989)And as for self-help advise follow only if given 1. by people that love you 2. by people that are smart and 3. by people that don’t have a personal interest.João Paleta

- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on August 6, 2013
- **内容**: You certainly get value for money with this book as the author covers Franklin's life in excellent detail. Despite Franklin being a perfect biographical subject he was involved in a political world that could be inaccessible to the general (UK) reader. In my opinion, the author pitches these sections of the book perfectly as to make them interesting and very readable - Please don't worry that this is merely a political biography as Franklin's interests were too diverse to let that happen.As someone pretty ignorant of the subject, I particularly enjoyed learning about Franklin's involvement in US Independence and as a result am prompted to read further on this period of US history.This was one of the best biographies I have read and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about the life and times of one of history's greatest characters. I will also be reading more from the author, H.W Brands.

- **内容**: This is not the first book I have read by H. W. Brands. He invariably writes with wit and insight and this trait was especially helpful when describing a man as witty and intellectually curious as Benjamin Franklin.  Brands has an uncanny knack of putting himself in the mindset of the person he writes about and seeing the world through that person's eyes.
