| 作者简介 | George Samuel Clason (November 7, 1874 – April 7, 1957 ), also known as George S. Clason, was born in Louisiana, Missouri, and died in Napa, California.
During his eighty two years he was a soldier, businessman and writer. He served in the United States Army during the Spanish–American War.
Clason started two companies, the Clason Map Company of Denver Colorado and the Clason Publishing Company. The Clason Map Company was the first to publish a road atlas of the United States and Canada, and did not survive the Great Depression.
George Clason is best known for writing a series of informational pamphlets about being thrifty and how to achieve financial success. He started writing the pamphlets in 1926, using parables that were set in ancient Babylon. Banks and insurance companies began to distribute the parables, and the most famous ones were compiled into the book The Richest Man in Babylon. Clason's book "Gold Ahead" was renamed as The Richest Man in Babylon. Clason was married twice, the first time to Ida Ann Venable and the second to Anna Burt.

- **内容**: I have read hundreds of finance books now, and I continue to do so. For me, The Richest Man in Babylon is the best financial book of all time. I came across it a few years ago when I read a reference for it in the book The Power of Focus: How to Hit Your Business, Personal and Financial Targets with Absolute Certainty. When I eventually read it, it was financial dynamite. I can see why many millionaires reccommend this book.Reading and applying the lessons in this book, has allowed me to boost my bank balance from sub-zero to well in excess of ten thousand pounds, in the space of a few years. I feel I understand the basic rules of money from reading this book, and though I am not a millionaire, I currently have FAR more money, wealth, and happiness than I would have had otherwise, and it just keeps increasing.The book is made up of small stories, which basically advocates a steady path to wealth building. It also talks about human emotions concerning money and through it's scenarios, covers basic lessons that anyone who has, or wants money will always encounter, and need to learn. It does all this via a collection of short tales which touch upon different areas.The only downside is that the actual book is written in old fashioned biblical style Olde English, so this can make it hard to understand for some people. Some reviewers have complained that it is too short, or the lessons too simple, but if the bankers had followed this advice, the great financial crash of 2007 may never have occurred. The Richest Man in Babylon, Arkad, says that "truth is always simple".It truly is a magnificent book and shows how wealth is really created. If I could only have one book on finance, this is the book I would choose. I've now read hundreds of books on finance, and this is the one I keep coming back to. This, and the book "The millionaire next door", are all one needs to be truly wealthy.It's currently 2009, and Britain is still experiencing one of the greatest economic downturns in history, but in spite of this I expect to increase my bank balance by thousands of pounds this year, and I have no debts. Next year, when house prices have crashed some more, I intend to add an investment property to my financial portfolio. At the moment, due to the current economic crisis, mortgages are harder to get than ever, but because of the deposit I have saved, and because my expenses are so low, many banks have confirmed that there will not be a problem for me. Thank you The Richest Man in Babylon.Finding this book has been one of the greatest landmarks in my life, it has produced real results for me without the hype or get rich quick mentality surrounding so many other finance books, and I will practice it's lessons forever.

- **内容**: I am the type of person who gets his wages paid in to his bank account and then the following day, they are all gone, and I wonder why I never have any money!My financial literacy dervies completely from this book. There is a new updated version of this book however I had no difficulty reading this version despite some of the language being archaic.The book teaches many principles on managing money through the telling of stories/parables. Not only is the advice excellent but the stories are really interesting too.One of the main themes of the book is that 'a part of all you earn is yours to keep.' This essentially means saving and as a general rule of thumb it recommends using 70% of your income for living expenses, 20% to pay debts and 10% to save. It sounds blindingly obvious but it's sound advice which I have spent a lifetime neglecting to use, spending all my money straight away on consumable items that don't provide any sort of return for my investment.If you are already financially literate then I doubt you will learn anything new from this book but nevertheless it is still a great read. If like me, you never seem to have any money in the bank account, then this book will be a huge wake up call and will help you to realise the errors of your ways.As soon as I start full time work next year following completion of a post-graduate course, I intend to start using the principles the book has taught me straight away.

- **内容**: I have read this book a couple of times and even given away a few copies of it to a couple of my friends. In other words, this book made such a big impression on me that I felt like I had to share it. It is a classic and it remains one of my absolute favorites.The book itself is relatively short and easy to read. The key points are easily understood and emphasized thoughout the book by the cleaver use of storytelling. I think that these are some of the reasons why this is such a great book.The book will offer its reader sound advice on how to allocate ones finances. However, there is little or no advice on how one is to manage ones allocations as such. In other words, the reader is going to learn how to accumulate a sum of money which can then be invested, but exactly how this capital is to be invested in todays markets is a whole different area which is outside the scope of this book. But the principles in this book will show the reader how to get started and it is then left to the reader to make the best of it.As long as we have a monetary system installed, I would say that this book is relevant. Therefore, this is just one of those books which I insist that my children read. I certainly wish that I had.So when you read this book, you will most like realize that you should have read it years ago and that is definately the worst part of this book.

- **内容**: I enjoy reading books that teach me something new, and I have a habit of marking impactful pages with tiny post-its. The more post-its sticking out, the more influential the book has been for me.The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason turned out to be a truly enjoyable and enlightening read. Written in a light, almost novel-like tone, it manages to deliver valuable lessons while being relaxing and pleasant to read.What I really appreciate about this book is its focus on building wealth through sound financial habits rather than chasing scams or get-rich-quick schemes. It emphasizes the importance of prioritizing your financial security in your spending habits and encourages readers to cultivate discipline and foresight.With a mix of practical tips and historical anecdotes, the book teaches simple yet effective strategies, such as increasing your income streams, saving consistently, seeking advice from qualified experts, being cautious of "know-it-alls," clearly defining your goals, lending wisely, and avoiding investments in unfamiliar ventures.Overall, it’s an inspiring and practical guide that I’d recommend to anyone looking to improve their financial literacy. I give it a solid 12 post-its!
