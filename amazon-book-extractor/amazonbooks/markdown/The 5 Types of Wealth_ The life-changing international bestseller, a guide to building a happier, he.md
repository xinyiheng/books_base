- **标题**: Can you imagine dancing at your 80th birthday? Great book with practical tips!!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2025
- **内容**: The 5 Types of Wealth is not just another book on personal finance-it's a powerful guide to living a rich, meaningful life. Sahil Bloom challenges the traditional notion of wealth by breaking it down into five dimensions: Financial, Social, Physical, Intellectual, and Time Wealth. This holistic approach resonated with me on a deeper level, making me rethink what it truly means to be "wealthy."I especially loved the thought experiments, like imagining yourself dancing at your 80th birthday or the story of the 90-year-old celebrating his birthday at Harvard. These moments made me reflect on the kind of life I want to build-not just in terms of money, but in experiences, health, and relationships.Sahil's storytelling is authentic and practical, and his advice is actionable without feeling overwhelming. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to redefine success and live intentionally. Highly recommend!

- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 March 2025
- **内容**: This book is amazing on so many levels and it's written by an incredibly kind and genuine human, who practices what he talks about. Having connected with Sahil online and attended his book launch event in London, all I can say is that I'm blown away and now I want to recommend his book to everyone I know.I love how 'active' it is, if you follow the prompts, there's no way that his book won't transform your life. I love all the illustrations and I love that Sahil draws attention to other types of wealth, reminding us that the "successful people" we look up to will have made trade-offs elsewhere. I love the focus on relationships too, because as Sahil reminds us, ultimately our social connections keep us alive. We should invest in our relationships like we invest our income.He also reminds us that we are time billionaires. We wouldn't trade our time in our youth for all the money in the world.It's all very comforting and serves as perfect guidance for how to live a more fulfilling life and how to be grateful for what we have. "The good old days are happening now", "anything above zero compounds"... I could go on 🤍

- **内容**: I was lucky enough to get an early release of 5 Types of Wealth, and honestly, it’s one of those books that will stay relevant for years to come!Sahil does an amazing job of breaking down wealth beyond just money.He dives into relationships, health, knowledge, and time in a way that really makes you rethink what “rich” actually means.It’s packed with insights that are easy to apply but also make you step back and reflect. This book is a must read.

- **评分**: 3.0
- **标题**: Powerful premise but rambles on too much
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2025
- **内容**: Very well laid out and constructed, asking powerful questions that will make you think about your priorities in life. I was enthused about this approach initially but if, like me, you’ve done a lot of research on some of these areas (e.g. fitness, nutrition, longevity), this feels more like a curated collection of existing research rather than anything new. So it’s useful but not hugely original in certain areas. In my view it’s better when the author articulates principles and concepts via stories from his lived experience, much more compelling.It seemed to me that by the time he reached the section on financial wealth, he’d run out of anything interesting to say. Hence the rather dry history lesson on money - lots of words but not much of interest (in my opinion). Basic summary of this section is: how much is enough for you? Understand this and then build a life and an approach to achieve this - pay no heed to what society tries to tell you about ever striving for more.Ultimately, I’m glad to have read (well, listened to) this book but it fell a little short for me.

- **内容**: Started reading Sahil’s book and it is amazing - I love how simply it is written and how insightful it is. The strategies and techniques that have been mentioned so far are very actionable rather than just theory based. I can’t wait to read further along… hoping there will be a sequel!
