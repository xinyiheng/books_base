| 内容简介 | #1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER • President Donald J. Trump lays out his professional and personal worldview in this classic work—a firsthand account of the rise of America’s foremost businessman.“Donald Trump is a deal maker. He is a deal maker the way lions are carnivores and water is wet.”—Chicago Tribune “I like thinking big. I always have. To me it’s very simple: If you’re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.”—Donald J. TrumpHere is Trump in action—how he runs his organization and how he runs his life—as he meets the people he needs to meet, chats with family and friends, clashes with enemies, and challenges conventional thinking. But even a maverick plays by rules, and Trump has formulated time-tested guidelines for success. He isolates the common elements in his greatest accomplishments; he shatters myths; he names names, spells out the zeros, and fully reveals the deal-maker’s art. And throughout, Trump talks—really talks—about how he does it. Trump: The Art of the Deal is an unguarded look at the mind of a brilliant entrepreneur—the ultimate read for anyone interested in the man behind the spotlight. |

- **内容**: This book still explains the essence of the man who is our President for the 2nd time. May he be able to bring his business acumen and vision to our troubled and severely overweight government, and clean out the useless dead weight in our democracy.Worth the read if you want to better understand our leader. The best part of this book is that it was written in about 1990 ish but the policies and directives he pursues today in 2025 still ring true.

Insight into the the man beyond what media shows us
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2016
- **内容**: Hi All!  I picked up The Art of the Deal just to see what it was all about.  This past year, the media can't go 30 seconds without saying "Trump" and it's a book I hear mentioned on TV daily, so I figured I'd give it a look.  What do I have to lose by reading, right?  I gotta tell ya, I found it interesting enough that I couldn't put it down.  Did I love it?  eh.. not really, but it's not that kind of book.  My normal genre of books are in the area of true war stories, WWII, Holocaust...  You know, real stories where people's lives were on the line.  I also like some political books, especially secret service books where retired agents tell what our politicians' lives are like when the cameras aren't rolling.  Those are the books that really keep me interested.The Art of the Deal, for me, was one of those books that kept me interested throughout.  For those that don't know, this is not a "how to" book at all.  It is a look into Donald Trump's life up to about 1987.  I was born in '76.  As a kid in the 80's, I remember quite a bit about Trump during the time of this book, which made me realize something:  Children who were born when The Apprentice began in 2004, are only 12 years old today, which means new 2016 voters were only 6 years old then.  They likely do not know anything more about Trump than he was the "You're Fired" guy on The Apprentice, or what the media decides we should see or think about him.  The main question I wanted answered by reading The Art of the Deal:  What is the man really like?I was not disappointed, in fact, I think this book gives more insight into why Trump is the way he is... How his mind works... what he might be thinking.  Keep in mind, the book is quite dated, but I did find it still very much relevant.  I enjoyed learning about Trump's upbringing and how he got started.  I enjoyed seeing all the "behind the scenes" work that went into his building deals, much of which would no doubt make a lesser person give up and try a different profession, especially when you inject big city politics and bureaucratic BS into the mix.  There really isn't much political stuff in this book, other than his experience with NYC political figures at the time.  If you are looking for his past political views, there are numerous old interviews on YouTube of Trump in the 80's and 90's that should shed some light.  All I can say is just with all political stuff, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH and don't let the media tell you what to think. 'Nuff said on that.Today, the media likes to make a big deal about Trump's little sound bytes, bankruptcies, etc., and basically paint him to look like a complete fool.  Well, I don't know about you, but turning a "small loan of a million dollars" from his father into a $10bn dollar global corporation?  You don't get to that level by being a foolish idiot.  There are a TON other people in the world who are hundreds of times richer who got to where they are by doing a lot less (ahem.. wall street speculators... cough cough.. hedge fund managers).So what did I take away from the book?  Trump is above all is a devout family man who despite being a workaholic, still managed to be an involved father who raised his kids right by instilling work ethic and high personal values... unlike the Kardiashian twits who have never had to work a day in their lives.  He is a man who understands how the world really works and uses that understanding to his advantage.  Whats most clear to me now having read this book is that Trump built his company the old fashioned way through relentless perseverance, hard work, and ability to see the bigger picture.I'm the kind of guy who gives credit where credit is due, and the bottom line I took away from the book is that  Trump is NOT the guy the media portrays.  He is a no BS guy who deserves respect.  I highly recommend reading this!

worth the read
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024
- **内容**: i actually liked this book very much. Understand Trump a whole lot better now and a whole different perspective than get on social media, news, and other public information sources. I love reading and when read what a person is the author of, you get to know them better than any other way. I want to know more intimately , the people we vote for and his books really reveal a lot plus i learned way more than i would ever have imagined. That's even a plus. This man is not at all how other people portray him or the impressions we get from bits and pieces of his public statements....When you read from cover to cover what are his own real ideas you do see that this person is a sheer genius and even more how he does care about the whole human race in ways most will never know or suspect.  His sarcasm and sharpness are not how he sees and talks all the time but do serve a unique purpose that most do not have a clue of ...what he is doing as the brilliant strategist he actually IS...BUT the more youu get to know him this way through reading his words and listening to his more intimate talks and longer , deeper delving into that...you find a person quite different from the personality on the screen but then you know what to look for and can see it there too.  He has tons of courage, love for the common man and for ideas and ways to make things better for all people...more than is at all obvious w/o a way deeper exaamination into his mind that only a book ...an honest book, can give.  Then when he is sarcastic or what may sound crass... in pointing out the people who we do need to have a deeper longer look at, and didn't have a clue of why and what their deception to the point of cruelty was and is ....and how he does know that and in knowing what we  DO NOT KNOW, and must if we are going to change things that need to be changed...this book and others he wrote....helps you see it and not just blindly accept his statements about them or them about him...but see for yourself . I am thrilled i did purchase and read this cover to cover ..and his other books that are even better..but this was a start where i barely knew him and didn't like him at all...now i love this man. and know him and that's why.

- **标题**: Le seul livre de Trump à retenir
- **日期**: Reviewed in France on September 15, 2010
- **内容**: Passionné par la lecture de ce livre, j'en ai acheté d'autres de Trump que j'ai refermé aussi sec. Depuis que Trump a troqué ses habits de titan de l'immobilier pour celui de star des média et qu'il a créé sa propre émission de télé réalité, l'homme est clairement pénible et ses livres beaucoup plus commerciaux que profonds !Ce livre toutefois est à part. Ecrit dans les années 80, alors qu'il était encore jeune et déjà très riche, son propos est de décrire tout son parcours au travers des plus belles affaires qui l'ont rendu célèbre. Le style est moins pédant, il ne l'a pas écrit pour ramasser de l'argent sur son nom, mais clairement pour expliquer son parcours. Le message est beaucoup plus authentique et sincère.Son bras droit, George Ross, l'homme de l'art derrière Trump écrira de lui en préface de son livre qu'il est le plus grand génie immobilier de son époque... J'en suis convaincu depuis que j'ai lu ce livre.Un livre très inspirant où il explique longuement et en détail ses plus grands deals ; il est passionnant de ce point de vue car il nous plonge au coeur de ce qu'est un deal immobilier dont la richesse, la diversité et la complexité sont surprenantes. Il faut dire qu'avec un tel guide, le voyage est clairement passionnant !On y découvre aussi son parcours. Issu d'un milieu aisé (plutot classe moyenne haute) mais sans commune mesure avec ce qu'il est devenu, on découvre un homme tenace et inspiré puisque très jeune il savait exactement ce qu'il voulait ; un homme dont tout le parcours a consisté à décliner cette vision. On découvre encore un homme patient qui sait attendre activement son tour, un homme de vision capable de voir la valeur là où les autres ne la voient pas (hotel commodore) et un homme sans concession vis à vis de ceux qui auront tenté de lui barrer le chemin. A l'évidence un génie de la négociation, stratège hors pair doté d'une incroyable intelligence de situation.Le seul livre de Trump à retenir, le seul vraiment authentique intéressant pour découvrir le bonhomme au delà de l'image arrogante et pédante qu'il s'est construite, mais aussi un livre très intéressant pour découvrir en détail la richesse de son métier.Pour ceux que l'aspect immobilier intéresse, je recommande aussi la lecture du livre écrit par son bras droit, George Ross intitulé "Trump stratégies for real estate", plus technique et dans lequel l'auteur tente de tiré des leçons en prenant des exemples concrets de son expérience avec Trump.Bref, à acheter si l'on s'intéresse à Donald Trump ou à l'immobilier du point de vue des professionnels.Un seul regret : je crois que ce livre n'est plus traduit en Français. Il faudra le lire en anglais mais l'homme n'étant pas particulièrement doué pour la littérature, le style est simple et le livre se lit facilement.
