| 作者简介 | Jon Yablonski is a multi-disciplinary designer who specializes in simplifying complex technology and making it intuitive through user research and interaction design. With over a decade of experience in design and development across various industries such as entertainment, retail, automotive, aerospace, and product, Jon brings a deep understanding of the relationship between human psychology and technology. When he’s not creating journey maps or crafting prototypes, Jon is creating digital tools to help designers such as Laws of UX and Humane by Design. |
| 内容简介 | An understanding of psychology-specifically the psychology behind how users behave and interact with digital interfaces-is perhaps the single most valuable nondesign skill a designer can have. The most elegant design can fail if it forces users to conform to the design instead of working within the "blueprint" of how humans perceive and process the world around them.  This practical guide explains how you can apply key principles of psychology to build products and experiences that are more human-centered and intuitive. Author Jon Yablonski deconstructs familiar apps and experiences to provide clear examples of how UX designers can build interfaces that adapt to how users perceive and process digital interfaces.  You'll learn: How aesthetically pleasing design creates positive responses The principles of psychology most useful for designers How these psychology principles relate to UX heuristics Predictive models including Fitts's law, Jakob's law, and Hick's law Ethical implications of using psychology in design A practical framework for applying principles of psychology in your design process This updated edition includes an even deeper connection to the underlying psychological concepts that govern the principles explored in the book, along with accompanying UX methods and techniques. Examples have been updated to ensure the deconstructed apps and experiences remain familiar and relevant. |

- **标题**: Excellent information without reading as an academic book.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on January 4, 2025
- **内容**: The advice in this book is invaluable and actionable and very readable. The book is well structured,  pointing out how to avoid design errors that will work against the user.  It considers ethics around the UX taking advantage of human psychology.  This is very important to me. I'm not interested in hooking users.  Rather in helping them achieve their goals (music improvisation).
