Invaluable and relevant advice for businesses and individuals
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2021
- **内容**: This book is superbly different to the other books out there that purport to help people run successful businesses.I can say this from the perspective of someone who has been working as an architect sole practitioner for over eleven years who bought this book as a way of reviewing how things have gone so far and where to go next. I know that if I had read this book at the start, I may have avoided several of the naïve big blunders that caused me huge financial stresses over the years. These include the classics of not (a) appreciating that 'Payments on Account' mean that you pay tax upfront just when your business is starting to do OK ... but not so OK that you have set aside money to pay for this tax and (b) not realising that VAT goes back the preceding 12 months NOT that tax year. (Although I have employed accountants from the start, they didn't warn me of this. I think the expectation was that I knew all of this already and that their job was simply to stick the figures I gave them into the correct boxes on the SA forms and inform me of the tax I had to pay).The Business Start Up Guide is very well written, realistic, pragmatic and to the point. It explains why you may take a decision on organising / structuring your business and what pitfalls to watch out for. It is the straightforward advice or 'hand holding' that people starting up small businesses crave but that most guides to accounting don’t tell you as they are written by accountants for accountants, even if they purport to be aimed at business owners.The authors are accountants and business owners themselves and have seen first hand mistakes that their clients have made and so can speak directly to extremely busy, time pressed people running businesses about what they need to work on and what dumb mistakes to avoid. Well worth the £9.95. The book is short because it is well edited and sticks to the point so you can get through it in a couple of hours while gaining a lot of insight.The authors have asked for feedback and questions for their next book. If I could ask, I would like to know more about the Covid grants and loans that were given out in a hurry but under vague terms and whether these vague terms will backfire on businesses in the future.
