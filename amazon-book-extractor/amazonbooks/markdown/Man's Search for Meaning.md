| 作者简介 | Viktor E. Frankl was professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of Vienna Medical School until his death in 1997. He was the founder of what has come to be called the Third Viennese School of Psychotherapy (after Freud's psychoanalysis and Adler's individual psychology)—the school of logotherapy. Born in 1905, Dr. Frankl received the degrees of Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Vienna. During World War II he spent three years at Auschwitz, Dachau and other concentration camps. Dr. Frankl first published in 1924 in the International Journal of Psychoanalysis and has since published twenty-six books, which have been translated into nineteen languages, including Japanese and Chinese. He was a visiting professor at Harvard, Duquesne, and Southern Methodist Universities. Honorary Degrees have been conferred upon him by Loyola University in Chicago, Edgecliff College, Rockford College, and Mount Mary College, as well as by universities in Brazil and Venezuela. He was a guest lecturer at universities throughout the world and made fifty-one lecture tours throughout the United States alone. He was President of the Austrian Medical Society of Psychotherapy. |
| 内容简介 | A book for finding purpose and strength in times of great despair, the international best-seller is still just as relevant today as when it was first published.“This is a book I reread a lot . . . it gives me hope . . . it gives me a sense of strength.”—Anderson Cooper, Anderson Cooper 360/CNNThis seminal book, which has been called “one of the outstanding contributions to psychological thought” by Carl Rogers and “one of the great books of our time” by Harold Kushner, has been translated into more than fifty languages and sold over sixteen million copies. “An enduring work of survival literature,” according to the New York Times, Viktor Frankl’s riveting account of his time in the Nazi concentration camps, and his insightful exploration of the human will to find meaning in spite of the worst adversity, has offered solace and guidance to generations of readers since it was first published in 1946. At the heart of Frankl’s theory of logotherapy (from the Greek word for “meaning”) is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but rather the discovery and pursuit of what the individual finds meaningful. Today, as new generations face new challenges and an ever more complex and uncertain world, Frankl’s classic work continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living, in spite of all obstacles.A must-read companion to this classic work, a new, never-before-published work by Frankl entitled Yes to Life: In Spite of Everything, is now available in English. |

excellent book - for many reasons
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2012
- **内容**: I recently completed a master's in counseling and guidance and have been reading to find a set of books that will best address some of the disorders in the DSM-IV. Following is a list I have put together from my reading so far, and these are books that I would HIGHLY recommend. I would like to say up front that the DSM-IV is full of very normal behaviors that for some reason have become magnified or exaggerated in an individual to the point of causing a negative impact in their daily lives. Take OCD for example, it is quite normal and even preferable (from a safety perspective) to check and be sure that one has turned off all the burners on the stove after cooking, or to be sure the back door is locked before going to bed. But to continue checking time and again would be problematic and can lead to problems in an individual's life. Something is diagnosed as a disorder when it moves from being a "normal" activity to being something that causes dysfunction in daily living. So, one may read the DSM-IV and see themselves reflected in many of the disorders. The question is always: is this behavior negatively impacting my life? If so then that is when it crosses the line of normal and needs to be treated.Depression; I believe there are two sources for depression: one source is our own minds, we think ourselves into the depression - at least in this case we know where it is coming from and we should be able to step behind our thoughts and help ourselves move in a better direction. The other source seemingly comes from nowhere; one minute we are okay and the next we are thrown into the depths* Book = "Transforming Depression: Healing the Soul Through Creativity"- David H. Rosen"o I would recommend reading this at least through chapter 4, going further than that delves into some deep Jungian psychology which will not likely appeal to everyone. I certainly enjoy Jungian psychology and believe that Jung's work will become more and more important and critical to our understanding as we move forward in this field of psychology. Jung's psychology is really on the borderland between spirit/soul and the science of psychology and it is Jung's work that brought me into this field. However it is quite complex/deep/different and may lose some readers. For a very good intro to Jung's work, I would recommend "The Essential Jung" by Anthony Storr, but this is not light reading as is composed of excerpts from Jung's collected works.* Book = "Man's Search for Meaning" - Viktor Franklo I would recommend this book for two primary reasons: one is it pushes very strongly the message that meaning is essential in our lives - as shown through Victor Frankl's imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps. Frankl comments on how he observed the individuals who gave up the fight and died, and the individuals who persevered -  and most importantly what it was that he believes made the difference. The other reason I recommend this book is that it helps the individuals whose thoughts may have led them to depression to realize that things could be worse. Of course there are devastations we may face that can truly be to us, just as bad as a Nazi concentration camps, but for the most part, we often push ourselves into depression for reasons that are somewhat superficial compared to other realities.Depersonalization Disorder - essentially feeling like you are not really there* Book = "Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self" - Daphne Simeon and Jeffrey Abugelo Excellent book which will help folks understand this disorder. This is for me a very interesting disorder, I think this is one disorder where the connection between our ego consciousness and perhaps what we are at a much deeper level is challenged. Normally we are locked into full belief in our reality  - we believe we are very much a part of it and that we "are" the body in which we reside. This disorder forces us to question if we are the body we think we are. It would appear that whatever piece of our mind is keeping us in full belief is breaking down a bit, leaving us a bit outside of the "normal" feeling of being the body. Folks with this disorder can actually worry that they do not have control of their body and that this body may do something they do not want it to do. Driving a car for example can be quite traumatic if you think your body may be acting without your input.Bipolar disorder - the book I am recommending is focused on Bipolar II disorder - essentially swinging from manic (very happy and carefree) to severe depression. This book was actually required reading during the Masters program* Book = "An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness" by Kay Redfield Jamisono Excellent book written by a psychologist who suffers from this disorder. This book helps to understand the importance of medication for this disorder, as well as the path of destruction that can easily be paved during carefree, manic episodes.ADHD (attention deficit disorder)* Book = "Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It" - Gabor Mateo This is not just a great book for folks with ADHD, but for everyone - as many of the lessons here translate to all of us. This is an extremely excellent book on ADHD and living in general.OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)* Book = "Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder" - Ian Osborno Excellent book on OCD - this book will help individuals with OCD as well as those who know someone with the disorder - to understand what is happening in the mind of a person with this disorder. This book will also help OCD folks realize that they are not alone and that many of the rituals or compulsions are shared by other folks with OCD.That is all for now, but I am still reading

A Profound and Life-Changing Read
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2025
- **内容**: Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning is one of the most powerful and moving books ever written. Combining his experiences as a Holocaust survivor with his groundbreaking psychological insights, Frankl explores how meaning and purpose can sustain us even in the darkest circumstances. His concept of logotherapy—the idea that our primary drive is not pleasure or power, but meaning—offers a transformative perspective on suffering and resilience. This book is both heartbreaking and deeply inspiring, reminding us of the strength of the human spirit. A must-read for anyone searching for purpose in life.

A must read
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2022
- **内容**: This 2008 edition of Frankl's 1945 book is a must read for every human being who wants to lift their spirit in moments of despair. The book is structured in three different parts. The first one (Experiences in a Concentration Camp) and the Postscript (The case for a Tragic Optimism) fit beautifully together, and are the basis of Frankl's philosophy and psychotherapy system called Logotherapy. They are narrated in a very conversational way because they are, after all, a memoir. They differ greatly in style and tone from the second part (Logotherapy in a Nutshell), which is a summary of Frankl's therapy system, partially based on Frankl's experiences and observations as Auschwitz inmate, and partially on techniques and views of the world that he had started elaborating before he was sent to the camp. This part is drier in style, way more technical and not as approachable for the reader, unless the reader is really into therapy or a therapist. Harold Kushner's preface to this 2008 edition is a good summary of the book main points, while Frankl's preface to the 1992 edition summarizes well how the book and Logotherapy came to be.  The book has many pearls of wisdom, and is very uplifting despite the brutality of what we read. In all honesty, I already expected that when I picked up the book. Some prisoner's stories are utterly poetic despite their tragedy. I'm glad that those people's historical memoirs had been so beautifully preserved. On the other hand, this is a survivor's first-person narration of the events, so that allows for invaluable insights into the reality of the extermination camps and into the inmates' mental/emotional state and fortune.Since we live in 2021 and we're pretty aware of the Nazis' atrocities, most of the things that Frankl tells about his experience are somewhat lessened by the impact on the reader of dozens of documentaries and movies on WW2. It might have been chilling reading the book in the postwar era, when all the details were still unfolding and the wold came to realize what had really happened.  What we didn't know before reading the book is that a new therapeutic model, Logotherapy, was greatly influenced by the Jew's suffering in Auschwitz, and that there is hope even in the biggest moments of despair.  For the rest, Frank's take on life is admirable and full of wisdom, whether you are into Logotherapy or not. I especially liked his comments on love, the youth and unemployment, as they are still, more than half a century later, valid. LOGOTHERAPY, SOME CORE PRINCIPLES AND POINTS I LIKE> The great task for any person is to find meaning in his/her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: Work (doing something significant), Love (caring for another person), and Courage in difficult times.> Suffering is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.> You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.> Logotherapy aims to curing the soul by leading it to find meaning in life.> What matters is to make the best of any given situation.>  Man’s main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life.> The aim of life is not to be happy as the seeking of happiness can increase someone's unhappiness.> Suffering is unavoidable, is part of life, and we need to accept it and re-frame it.> Tragic optimism, i.e., one remains optimistic in spite of the “tragic triad, or  those aspects of human existence which may be circumscribed by: (1) pain; (2) guilt; and (3) death and that we should say 'yes' to life in spite of all that.> To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic. > Success cannot be pursued but it is an end result that the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.There are hundreds of pearls of wisdom that I cannot reproduce here because it would take too long, but those are the ones that made me read the book in the first place.SOME CRITIQUEFrankl poignantly mentions that despite all the inmates being subject to the harsh situations (food and sleep deprivation, hard-work labor, extreme cold, beatings, etc.) some died and some survived, and he ways that, many of those who died did so because they gave up on life and lose hope in getting alive out of the camps and resuming their lives after the war.I love most of what Frankl says and his attitude towards life. However, we cannot say that Frankl survived just because he had a specific mindset, hopes of getting alive, finding his family and publishing the basics of Logotherapy included in this edition, which he had already started writing before being taken to the camp. First of all, he was an intellectual and  a psychiatrist, i.e. a person with a strong mind, mentally s stable with enough intellectual harnesses to re-frame anything in his head to give it meaning. He certainly was an optimistic, like it's in his nature. Not everyone was so well equipped mentally and emotionally. What's more, there must have been other people who, like him, had hopes of surviving, seeing their families and doing something with their lives in the outside world, but they never made it because, I can only hypothesize, their physique and immune system, as well as their mental state weren't Frankl's.

- **标题**: pound-for-pound one of the best books available
- **日期**: Reviewed in Australia on April 30, 2017
- **内容**: What a spectacular gift Frankl has given society in this book. A truly heartbreaking account of time in various SS camps, the journey the author took is just as jaw-dropping as the place he found himself at the end.Man's Search For Meaning is an excellent perspective-checker, an excellent first-hand account of how horrible people can be to each other, a tribute to the human ability to make sense of the suffering and pain one endures, and a poignant insight into the psychology that kept some prisoners alive in Auschwitz while others perished.I was continually struck with the way Frankl beautifully weaves discussion of psychology and the ways in which people respond to shocking circumstances into the description of the realities facing the prisoners in the Nazi death camps. The book is an ongoing push-pull between feeling utterly sick reading the occurrences in the camp and inspired by the positions taken by some prisoners, as well as the beauty that sporadically managed to shine into the camp. Hope is one of the most powerful forces available to humanity, and it energised the prisoners as no bread or water could.The new addition of a discussion of Logotherapy is very helpful for application into one's own life today, and much of Frankl's explanation of it seems logical and with merit. It's a testament to the quality of the writer that both halves of the book are equally enthralling to read and ingest.I feel I may need to put this into a rotation to allow the concepts to sink deeper. I wish more people wrote with grace and beauty like Frankl; He shows beauty in the midst of terror and maintains an objective perspective like nobody else I've read. A story of Frankl speaking to the other prisoners and encouraging them to find hope and see the positives of their imprisonment is one of the finest things I've read.

- **标题**: L’homme ne peut vivre sans donner un sens à sa vie.
- **日期**: Reviewed in France on September 1, 2021
- **内容**: « Man’s Search for Meaning » résulte des expériences vécues par Viktor E. Frankl dans les camps de concentration de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale.La quête de sens, d’une mission à accomplir, est d’après Viktor, le facteur qui a déterminé la survie, ou la mort des prisonniers. L’homme qui n’a rien pour vivre, rien pour le porter à travers son existence, non seulement, se traîne à travers les journées, mais se dirige lentement vers sa mort.Viktor parle de « vide existentiel » — lorsqu’une personne souffre d’un manque terrible de sens à sa vie. Et l’homme qui n’a alors rien pour le guider dans la vie, navigue le monde à la peur. Ainsi, vient le conformisme : l’individu préfère suivre la masse (car ne sachant pas ce qu’il veut), ou le totalitarisme : l’individu suit ce qu’on lui ordonne de faire (car ne sachant pas ce qu’il veut).Ces personnes alors en proie à leur vide existentiel n’ont pour seul réconfort que les plaisirs, la gratification immédiate. Dans les camps de concentration, ceux ayant abandonné, sortaient de leur poche une cigarette durement protégée pour commencer à la fumée. Les autres autour savaient que les cendres tombant des lèvres de ces hommes, représentaient leurs dernières lueurs de vie.Seulement, les cigarettes étaient le seul plaisir immédiat dans la vie infernale des camps. Dans la vie de tous les jours, notamment en ce qui concerne les jeunes, les choix se font plus nombreux.C’est ainsi, que Viktor explique la débauche de la jeunesse — créée par un vide existentiel — qui pour alors se conforter dans leur existence creuse, se jette sur drogues, alcools, et activités sexuelles. Le livre va même plus loin : agressions et suicides.Ceux n’ayant pas un sens à leur vie, ne peuvent vivre pour le futur. Alors, ils sont naturellement en proie aux émotions de l’instant, et qu’importent les effets sur le lendemain, car celui-ci n’a pas de sens.Bien sûr, le but de ce livre n’est pas d’extrapoler sur le manque de sens de la vie de certains, et les problèmes que cela engendre. Mais bien, d’offrir aux gens, l’opportunité de créer du sens de leur souffrance. D’arriver à trouver un sens à leur existence — car il y en a bien un.Viktor parle de retourner la question. Ne pas chercher ce que l’on veut de la vie, mais plutôt, chercher ce que la vie veut de nous. Chacun est unique et irremplaçable. Chacun à sa pierre à apporter à l’édifice. Chacun est venu ici pour une raison. Chacun est mis au défi chaque jour par la vie.Ainsi, aussi unique et irremplaçable que nous sommes. Nous avons chacun, une ou des uniques choses, que nous seuls pouvons accomplir. Des choses merveilleuses qui sans nous, ne verraient pas le jour.Et comme chacun est unique, il n’existe pas de réponse globale au « sens de la vie ». Mais plutôt, un sens à la vie de chacun — en fonction du moment et de la situation. Ainsi, la destinée n’est que les choses auxquels, un, doit faire face, avec courage et surtout dignité.Viktor veut donc qu’on prenne la responsabilité de notre vie, et de nos actes. Il veut aussi que l’on comprenne que la vie n’est pas à vivre sans effort. Mais plutôt sous tension, dans la réalisation d’une quête librement choisie.La souffrance est quelque chose qui fait pleinement partie de la vie. Ainsi lorsqu’elle ne peut être évitée, l’homme peut toujours exercer son bien le plus puissant : son attitude face à l’évènement. Si tu ne peux pas contrôler ce qui arrive, tu peux toujours contrôler comment tu y réagis, comment tu y fais face.La souffrance peut ainsi être transformée. Tu peux trouver un sens à ta souffrance. Que ce soit une préparation pour des évènements à venir, ou quelque chose de nécessaire à ton évolution. La souffrance doit être remise en perspective — pour en comprendre l’objectif. En bref, ce qui t’arrive à une raison d’être, et si tu arrives à la trouver, tu te hisseras au-dessus de la souffrance.Néanmoins, Viktor insiste bien que la souffrance n’est pas nécessaire à la quête de sens. Mais, bien que la quête de sens soit possible en dépit. Ainsi, quand la souffrance est inutile et évitable, il faut l’éviter. Dans le cas contraire, cela serait du pur masochisme et non, comme l’auteur le dit, de l’héroïsme.Pour finir, Viktor dit que l’homme n’est ni guidé par (et vers) la puissance, l’argent, ou le plaisir. Mais bien, par (et vers) un sens, une signification, à ses actes et à sa vie.« Celui qui a un "pourquoi" qui lui tient lieu de but, peut vivre n'importe quel "comment". »- NietzscheEt ce livre a la volonté de te montrer comment tu peux trouver ton pourquoi. Pour que tu puisses endurer n’importe quel comment. Pour que ta vie semble riche de sens, et destinée à accomplir quelque chose de plus grand que toi-même.Le sens est la plus grande force de motivation. Sans elle, nous sommes vides et mourants. Avec elle, nous fleurissons.« Man’s Search for Meaning » est bel-et-bien une lecture indispensable à notre époque, où trop souvent nous pensons à tort, que tout est perdu, quand tout encore est à faire.
