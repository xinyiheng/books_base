| 内容简介 | Wall Street Journal bestseller!   For anyone who wants to be heard at work, earn that overdue promotion, or win more clients, deals, and projects, the bestselling author of Captivate, Vanessa Van Edwards, shares her advanced guide to improving professional relationships through the power of cues.What makes someone charismatic? Why do some captivate a room, while others have trouble managing a small meeting? What makes some ideas spread, while other good ones fall by the wayside? If you have ever been interrupted in meetings, overlooked for career opportunities or had your ideas ignored, your cues may be the problem – and the solution. Cues – the tiny signals we send to others 24/7 through our body language, facial expressions, word choice, and vocal inflection – have a massive impact on how we, and our ideas, come across. Our cues can either enhance our message or undermine it. In this entertaining and accessible guide to the hidden language of cues, Vanessa Van Edwards teaches you how to convey power, trust, leadership, likeability, and charisma in every interaction. You’ll learn:  •  Which body language cues assert, “I’m a leader, and here’s why you should join me.”  •  Which vocal cues make you sound more confident  •  Which verbal cues to use in your résumé, branding, and emails to increase trust (and generate excitement about interacting with you.)  •  Which visual cues you are sending in your profile pictures, clothing, and professional brand. Whether you're pitching an investment, negotiating a job offer, or having a tough conversation with a colleague, cues can help you improve your relationships, express empathy, and create meaningful connections with lasting impact. This is an indispensable guide for entrepreneurs, team leaders, young professionals, and anyone who wants to be more influential. |

Most inciteful book I have ever read
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2025
- **内容**: So I saw Vanessa Van Edwards "Diary of a CEO" episode on YouTube and I was intrigued, so I bought her book. It is literally the best book I have ever read that explains the social and internal cues I go through on a daily basis. I am so pleased with my purchase, I felt the need to share it with you here! :) Thank you Vanessa for writing this masterpiece, I am truly in awe. Not only has this book improved my connections with other people, but it has changed the way I am perceived, and has given me a leg up in such things like: negotiating, brand perception, and acceptance with others. It feels like a life hack and I am constantly amazed at how much of my life I had left to chance before, where now I get to take control and be in the drivers' seat. Thank you Vanessa!

Helpful book for anyone with ideas you want to share. Could not stop reading once I started.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2022
- **内容**: One of the ways to be “efficient” is to be able to quickly engage with your potential mate, counterpart, partner, or audience. This takes charisma, which the book clearly and directly shows you how to achieve.The examples in this book are well-researched behavioral topics which are immediately actionable to help you with your everyday interactions. Unlike similar books which are often difficult to understand, this author makes a potentially dense topic applicable to emails, meeting people, texting, and public speaking with clear examples. It is a very easy read.As a “competent” professional, I immediately *intentionally* implemented some of the “warm” cues to enhance engagement and interaction with my “customers” – can you say charisma?!Yes. Charisma is a teachable / learnable skill.Knowledge of the cues will also allow you to clearly decipher another’s body language so you can immediately and CONTEXTUALLY respond to your advantage. This impacts on everyday interactions such as dating, sales, or simply speaking with your significant other.I changed how I set up one of my video cameras based on some of the recommendations in the book so I can improve audience engagement in my online videos. I changed what I do when I first meet a new “customer” to immediately “bond” by encoding multiple cues.We all have great ideas. Minding your Ps and “cues” will help you DELIVER your great ideas so they are not inadvertently lost in communication.Learn your cues. Reach your success efficiently.P.S. I will be hosting a book club among my professional colleagues on this book very soon. It’s THAT impactful.

Be in control of your cues
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2022
- **内容**: Have you wondered why some people seem to ignore you when you share an idea, only to have one of your colleagues pitch the exact same idea and get noticed? Do you struggle with social engagements and feel as if people want to just move on after a few minutes? Or do you just want to become better, more engaging, and more influential?In her new book, Cues, Vanessa Van Edwards breaks down the secret sauce that can help us to all become more charismatic.  Vanessa starts with an explanation of what exactly is charisma. Spoiler alert, it is a myth that people are just born with charisma. The good news is that we all have the power to change, and Vanessa provides us insights on how.With every verbal or nonverbal interaction, we are sending cues to others. Vanessa defines cues as the powerful verbal, nonverbal, and vocal signals humans send to each other.  In Cues, Vanessa breaks myriad cues into 4 cue buckets (nonverbal, vocal, verbal, imagery).  Each of these is clearly explained and she provides relevant examples from celebrities, media, and TV shows.In addition to the material in the book, Vanessa shares how to access several digital bonuses including videos of the actual examples, book club discussion questions, and an upcoming app.As Vanessa advises, don't leave charisma up to chance. You have the power to send the cues to increase your charisma. Be in control of your cues, read Cues.
