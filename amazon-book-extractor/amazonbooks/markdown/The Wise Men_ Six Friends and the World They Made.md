| 内容简介 | With a new introduction by the authors, this is the classic account of the American statesmen who rebuilt the world after the catastrophe of World War II.A captivating blend of personal biography and public drama, The Wise Men introduces six close friends who shaped the role their country would play in the dangerous years following World War II. They were the original best and brightest, whose towering intellects, outsize personalities, and dramatic actions would bring order to the postwar chaos and leave a legacy that dominates American policy to this day. The Wise Men shares the stories of Averell Harriman, the freewheeling diplomat and Roosevelt’s special envoy to Churchill and Stalin; Dean Acheson, the secretary of state who was more responsible for the Truman Doctrine than Truman and for the Marshall Plan than General Marshall; George Kennan, self-cast outsider and intellectual darling of the Washington elite; Robert Lovett, assistant secretary of war, undersecretary of state, and secretary of defense throughout the formative years of the Cold War; John McCloy, one of the nation’s most influential private citizens; and Charles Bohlen, adroit diplomat and ambassador to the Soviet Union. |

A Spotlight on Public Service
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2025
- **内容**: There are politicians, and then there are the diplomats , advisors and experts and so many others that advise on and implement policies and decisions.  History needs to record the service of these people if only provide a goal or measurement for the future.  These men served over a forty year period that included world war, the atomic bomb, the State of Israel, the Korean war, The Viet Nam war and the cold war.  They served under presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson.  This is  an important book.  It is well written.  Every American citizen needs a better understanding of how our government works.  This highly readable book would be a good place to start.

Great look at 1920-1980
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2020
- **内容**: As someone who is to the right politically than the authors I was happily surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. I felt as though the authors missed the boat with Reagan and his relationship to the soviets, thankfully it was a very small part of the overall book. The authors suffered from a 1980s liberal anathema of all things Reagan and history proved them wrong about the efficacy of his policies. The antipathy towards Reagan has the authors offering up an almost naive view of the Soviets and it was my only issue with the book. Common sense AND HISTORY proves my point and is shown by the benign attitude the authors have towards Yuri Andropov, a former KGB head and a serious problem regarding freedom for people in Eastern Europe, and for the world.Having said my piece above I still give the book 5 stars due to how much I loved how the authors gave us the feel of the times and how our six heroes dealt with all of it's issues and crises.Being a Dean Acheson fan I found his part of the book fascinating and it just reinforced all of my prior thoughts about this giant of the 20th century. I feel as if there should be a movie made of Acheson as a way to introduce him to today's students and others...but I know it will never happen. Anyone who doesn't know Dean Acheson should read some books by or about him.Being a fan of the time period I of course was familiar with Averell Harriman, but I wasn't aware of exactly what a giant of the times he was. As the book progressed I found myself thinking that he was an opportunist, a man that wanted "it" to be all about him, but as the book progressed I came to respect him more and more. This is especially true when he did not get his coveted Secretary of State position and yet never tried to torpedo Acheson, who did get the job. This is so unlike today and that is a shame. Harriman kept on and kept on and I found him also fascinating. His desire for diplomatic means of solving problems was legendary.I found Chip Bohlen to be totally enjoyable, cool and as "hip" as anyone from today...he came across as timeless. The picture of him and JFK driving down the street, Kennedy with his shades on and at the wheel showed the man perfectly.Robert Lovett as someone I had never heard of and yet he was also a huge force during momentous times. Almost as rich as Harriman, but not nearly as stuffy, his part was a great part of the book as well.As someone who followed foreign affairs a bit I was very familiar with George F, Kennan (Mr. X)  but I was surprised by his being so sensitive with regard to being insecure. A great mind and perfect for the early cold war period.John McCloy was someone who is so underrated when discussing historic people of the second half of the 20th century. He combined public and private service that could (and should) never be allowed today, but his contribution was huge and very positive and that is why so many presidents called on him for assistance.Anyone who is interested in WWII, the Cold War, the Korean War and the Vietnam War should read this book. Anyone interested in high society in the 20s thru the 80s should read this book. It was a different time, but we would not be us without how well our country handled events and how these man contributed to the world.

Comprehensive and Engaging
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2017
- **内容**: As happens frequently in biographies, the authors fell in love with their subjects; praise for the 6 main members of the Cold War "Establishment" far outweighs criticism.  Averell Harriman and Dean Acheson get the most thorough attention among the 6 subjects, and rightfully so.I took away one star because the authors largely see the foreign policies of Republican presidents Ike, Nixon and Reagan through the eyes of the Wise Men, instead of objectively.  Only when Nixon "comes to his senses" and asks Acheson and Harriman for advice does he receive some praise.  Ike's foreign policy era is portrayed as one to be endured until the Wise Men are allowed back in the inner circle under JFK. Their total disdain for Reagan is clear; no mention of the reasons for end of the Cold War and Reagan's active part in it.However, the 5-star section of the book is clearly the LBJ-Vietnam era.  Wow, they really can't stand LBJ as a human being and politician, but his (and the Wise Men's) agony over the Vietnam war is written about almost lyrically.  The authors convey the complicated global factors of the war in an admirable, even-handed, almost sympathetic way.

How The World Was Designed After World War II
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2009
- **内容**: The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made with a new introduction by the authors Six American boys who were childhood friends, and who held few public offices, came, through their individual and collective efforts, to simply design, during and just after World Ware II, the whole world as we know it today. Yes, these six men really did design the whole world, the whole world that we know, the whole world.The six men, Dean Acheson, Charles Bohlen, Averell Harriman, George Kennan, Robert Lovett and John McCloy really did design the whole world. Their personal lives were intertwined from their childhoods and schooldays, and from their early careers on Wall Street and in government jobs.By breeding and training these six men, and a few of their close colleagues, knew that America would have to assume the burden of a global role. Out of duty and out of desire, and probably out of divine inspiration, they heeded their own individual calls to public service.These six were the original "best and brightest" of twentieth-century men. Their outsized personalities, and forceful actions, brought order to the post-war chaos and left a legacy that dominates the way the world works to this very day.The book is masterfully written by Walter Isaacson, now of Time magazine, and Evan Thomas, currently Assistant Managing Editor at Newsweek.The authors bring the hundreds of world defining moments into clear focus and illustrate how effective six citizens can be. We can all follow their examples of how to lead, in the most personal way, our own livesThe book very easily readable and I just could not put it down until I had finished it. The book can take you on an exciting ride through the myriad events that created the world we live in today.The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made with a new introduction by the authors
