| 内容简介 | The AI revolution is here, poised to upend every industry in its wake. But how will this new technology actually change how we build companies? In the face of algorithms and machine learning, intangibles that are uniquely human—skills like creativity, adaptability and leadership—will be the clear drivers for growth.Creating the Intangible Enterprise explains how AI will fundamentally change the landscape and, most importantly, shows leaders how to leverage the uniquely human skills—like emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and communication—that will become even more valuable in a world where the transactional aspects of work are handled by technology.KP Reddy, the author of What You Know About Startups Is Wrong and BIM For Building Owners and Developers, has been investing and building AI- and robotics-based startups for decades. The renowned founder and investorlays out the playbook for companies to succeed in the age of AI, including:Deeply understanding your customers' specific concerns and crafting the perfect customer experienceEmphasizing intangible factors like perception, reputation, and emotional connection that will become brand differentiatorsOrganizations focused on leadership promoting ethical decision-making, problem-solving, and personal development will be best-positioned to succeed in complex and fast-moving situations"We are on the cusp of potentially enormous AI-driven disruptions to foundational economic and social structures. KP outlines a tangible approach to thriving in an AI-driven world and details why the focus of AI disruption may be in industries that have been historically slow to innovate.” — Sam Chandan, Founding Director, Chen Institute for Global Real Estate Finance at the NYU Stern School of BusinessReddy emphasizes that as we grapple with AI and how it shapes the future, the reality is that we’re not yet capable of understanding all of its applications. However, in this uncertain new world, those leaders who double down on human-centered leadership skills will be the ones to succeed. |

So Powerful and Timely
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2024
- **内容**: Wow, just as I am getting to learn ChatGPT, comes a book that makes AI easy to understand and real. I'm going to buy a copy of this for my geeky IT brother as well. As a generationally challenged wedge generation (I refuse to call myself a boomer), I need books like this that break down technology for me and help me understand the complicated in a simple and relevant manner.  We can't ignore Artificial Intelligence so we need to learn about it and embrace it.From the outset, the book provides a comprehensive overview of how AI is transforming various industries and reshaping traditional business models. What sets this book apart is its focus on the "intangible" aspects of enterprise—skills and strategies that are often overlooked but crucial for long-term success.The author delves deep into critical skills such as strategic thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence, and adaptability. Each chapter is meticulously crafted with real-world examples, practical tips, and actionable insights that make complex concepts accessible and engaging. The writing style is clear and concise, making it easy for readers from diverse backgrounds to grasp the content.One of the book's strengths is its balanced approach. While it provides a thorough understanding of the technological advancements driving AI, it also emphasizes the human element—how we can leverage our unique capabilities to complement and enhance AI-driven systems. This holistic perspective is not only refreshing but necessary in a world where the intersection of technology and humanity is becoming increasingly significant.Moreover, the case studies and interviews with industry leaders included in the book offer valuable perspectives and lessons learned from those who are at the forefront of the AI revolution. These firsthand accounts enrich the narrative and provide a tangible sense of the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.In summary, Creating the Intangible Enterprise is a must-read for business leaders, professionals, and anyone interested in thriving in an AI-driven world. It equips readers with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the complexities of the future with confidence and resilience. Highly recommended!

You're missing out if you haven't read this already
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2024
- **内容**: This book is an excellent read and another great one from KP Reddy.  KP has the ability to take such a complex  subject such as aI and makes it approachable and understandable for someone ready to take the next step to grow.Each chapter is filled with practical applications, and real examples that you can easily relate with. The content isn't just theoretical but is actually insightful. If you have a business leader, a tech junky or simply curious about what AI will do for your industry you should check out this book. It's a great place to start, other books on this subject feel like textbooks, filled with technical jargon and things that go over your head. "Creating the Intangible Enterprise" does not feel like that, it's highly engaging and an easy read.I came to this book after reading KP's "What you know about startups is wrong" which is another book I highly recomend for any early-stage startu pfounder or team member,.

A different perspective on Civil Engineering!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2024
- **内容**: If you know KP, you know that he will often comment that he is a civil engineer, just contributing to the profession in a different way.Which is a good thing - how many books on technology are specifically about our industry? (hint: not many).What "Creating the Intangible Enterprise" offers is a different way of thinking about the problems that our profession and industry faces, such as:-Use technology and AI not for incremental efficiency gains, but for new ways of doing business entirely.-How a company's brand is more than just facts, figures, and specifications - the intangibles that we "feel", but can't always assign a quantifiable metric to.-How to navigate all of this change in a risk-averse industry.The above is what the book tells you directly, but the beauty of the book is that it gets you to think about the possibilities beyond what is outlined. For example:-How does an innovation strategy attract likeminded individuals to your firm? How can these "Superusers" positively impact the firm's course?-What have you or your firm always dreamed of being able to make a reality, that is now possible because of the advent of AI and other emerging technologies?-How do we work with startups to help accelerate solving the issues we face today, and stay abreast of the issues we will face tomorrow?TLDR: a good book entertains, a great book makes you think and apply. KP's is in the latter category.
