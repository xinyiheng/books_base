| 内容简介 | An Instant #1 New York Times BestsellerFrom the New York Times bestselling author and MSNBC and podcast host, a powerful wide-angle reckoning with how the assault from attention capitalism on our minds and our hearts has reordered our politics and the very fabric of our society“An ambitious analysis of how the trivial amusements offered by online life have degraded not only our selves but also our politics.” —New York Times“Brilliant book… Reading it has made me change the way I work and think.”—Rachel MaddowWe all feel it—the distraction, the loss of focus, the addictive focus on the wrong things for too long. We bump into the zombies on their phones in the street, and sometimes they’re us. We stare in pity at the four people at the table in the restaurant, all on their phones, and then we feel the buzz in our pocket. Something has changed utterly: for most of human history, the boundary between public and private has been clear, at least in theory. Now, as Chris Hayes writes, “With the help of a few tech firms, we basically tore it down in about a decade.” Hayes argues that we are in the midst of an epoch-defining transition whose only parallel is what happened to labor in the nineteenth century: attention has become a commodified resource extracted from us, and from which we are increasingly alienated. The Sirens’ Call is the big-picture vision we urgently need to offer clarity and guidance.Because there is a breaking point. Sirens are designed to compel us, and now they are going off in our bedrooms and kitchens at all hours of the day and night, doing the bidding of vast empires, the most valuable companies in history, built on harvesting human attention. As Hayes writes, “Now our deepest neurological structures, human evolutionary inheritances, and social impulses are in a habitat designed to prey upon, to cultivate, distort, or destroy that which most fundamentally makes us human.” The Sirens’ Call is the book that snaps everything into a single holistic framework so that we can wrest back control of our lives, our politics, and our future. |

A tough, but unfortunately true read.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2025
- **内容**: Chris Hayes is brilliant in his newest book.  His premise is that attention has become a commodity being sought after across our lives, mainly through our phones.  Our attention spans have become minuscule and our ability to stay focused has diminished.  Not a pretty sight and not a great harbinger of things to come.  Definitely worth reading....

An excellent, informative book...
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2025
- **内容**: This is an outstanding and exceptional read. Even though I had an understanding of marketing and algorithms, and the length to which people will go to get our attention, I still found this book to be very informative and useful. I had already been taking a break from social media and the news, and this reinforced the reasons why it's necessary.

Interesting analysis by a person in a unique position to know
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2025
- **内容**: Very interesting book which I would encourage everyone to read. However, I would like to make another point: Chris, "gift" is a noun, not a verb. The verb is "give". There is no need to write a sentence like "He gifted her a watch" when you can be grammatically correct (and save two letters) by writing "He gave her a watch."

somewhat pretentious
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2025
- **内容**: The book was interesting in some things.  I had never thought about how we all trip on attention.  The author was  skillful at putting sentences and thoughts together but he used esoteric words when the commonly used version would have been more user friendly.  Why use a word that someone has to put your book down to look up when a word that they already know would have done the job

- **日期**: Reviewed in Canada on March 6, 2025
- **内容**: I purchased this for my mother. I was unable to bring it to her so I thought I would read it. GREAT book. I think everyone using a cell phone and those saturated with all forms of social media should give this a read. It changes your mind about pulling out the cell phone at dinner. In fact, it changes the way you look at how we as a society pay attention.
