| 内容简介 | “Careless People is darkly funny and genuinely shocking...Not only does [Sarah Wynn-Williams] have the storytelling chops to unspool a gripping narrative; she also delivers the goods." -Jennifer Szalai, The New York Times “When one of the world’s most powerful media companies tries to snuff out a book ― amid other alarming attacks on free speech in America like this ― it’s time to pull out all the stops.” –Ron Charles, The Washington Post An explosive memoir charting one woman’s career at the heart of one of the most influential companies on the planet, Careless People gives you a front-row seat to Facebook, the decisions that have shaped world events in recent decades, and the people who made them. From trips on private jets and encounters with world leaders to shocking accounts of misogyny and double standards behind the scenes, this searing memoir exposes both the personal and the political fallout when unfettered power and a rotten company culture take hold. In a gripping and often absurd narrative where a few people carelessly hold the world in their hands, this eye-opening memoir reveals what really goes on among the global elite. Sarah Wynn-Williams tells the wrenching but fun story of Facebook, mapping its rise from stumbling encounters with juntas to Mark Zuckerberg’s reaction when he learned of Facebook’s role in Trump’s election. She experiences the challenges and humiliations of working motherhood within a pressure cooker of a workplace, all while Sheryl Sandberg urges her and others to “lean in.” Careless People is a deeply personal account of why and how things have gone so horribly wrong in the past decade―told in a sharp, candid, and utterly disarming voice. A deep, unflinching look at the role that social media has assumed in our lives, Careless People reveals the truth about the leaders of Facebook: how the more power they grasp, the less responsible they become and the consequences this has for all of us. |

- **内容**: "Careless People" arrived yesterday, and once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. This one is a 10 out of 10" read. Hilarious in spots, well-written, and revealing, it's also disturbing, and a strident klaxon trying to get our attention, even though the author knows it may be too late. I bought it because Mark Zuckerberg tried to silence the author, which seems to contradict his whole "free speech " position on which he shut down content moderation. I dislike censorship and don't approve of book banning.Full disclosure, I'm not a fan of Facebook since the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal. I left the platform and never looked back. I don't miss it. This book makes me doubly glad to be away from all that, and also leaves me concerned that it's even possible to appropriately regulate big tech companies to secure humanity's future privacy (and safety).If you're feeling like *something* is wrong in the world and can't quite put your finger on exactly what, this book is a great start - and a genuinely fun read. Definitely buy this book while you can. (Maybe from someone other than Amazon.)

Interesting!

- **内容**: I came across it in an article on Hacker News and decided to buy it impulsively. It was delivered the next day, and out of curiosity, I started reading it right away.I'm currently on page 23—I'm a bit of a slow reader—but so far, I really like the dynamic style of Sarah's writing. The story starts off with an engaging pace, and I appreciate how the events unfold in a dynamic, interesting way. The theme of diplomacy is new to me, and I find it both curious and enjoyable.

Worth reading!!

- **内容**: This is a fascinating account by a former Facebook insider. I couldn't put it down as it is riveting and disturbing. It isn't hard to understand why Facebook is fighting to silence the author. I'm not sure why Amazon rejected my first review as against their standards; there was no profanity, hate speech etc in my review. This is a book worth reading and a lot to think about

GRIPPING
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2025
- **内容**: I'm 3/4 of the way through and the book is INCREDIBLE, yet completely consistent with what we know of Zuckerberg & Sandberg so far — they are power-hungry and only marginally concerned with the profound and dire consequences of their choices.Absolutely alarming that after coming to realize that his platform swung the 2016 election in favor of Trump, Zuckerberg ... decides to run for president. Equally, or even more alarming, is the revelation that FB execs were completely willing to let the Chinese Communist Party harvest Chinese users' info if they would allow FB to operate in China. Also completely baffling that Joel Kaplan had to be told that paying politicians to do FB's bidding would be bribery.The author speaks in neutral, common-sense language, describing observable actions — words said, things done. This is an absolutely damning account of the 3 people in power at FB during the years it had a profound and irrevocable influence on America and many other countries' elections, social discourse, and way of life.Thank you, Sarah, for your courage writing this book. Unsurprisingly Meta has issued a laughable PR statement about it and is attempting to stop the author from marketing her book. We need more whistleblowers like Haugen & Winn-Williams. These companies absolutely rule our lives. It's because of them, and especially Meta, that we are drowning in political polarization. These 3 execs deserve our collective outrage, and they owe America and the world a mea culpa — which, of course, we're never going to get.

Behind the Carefully Curated Curtain
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2025
- **内容**: Careless People delivers exactly what its Gatsby-inspired title promises - a front-row seat to the carefree destruction wrought by tech's elite when nobody's looking. As a former Sheryl Sandberg admirer who devoured "Lean In," I approached this book expecting bombshells but found something more nuanced: a workplace memoir that's less explosive exposé and more tech-industry "Devil Wears Prada."Wynn-Williams offers fascinating glimpses behind Meta's carefully maintained public image, revealing the stark contrast between polished corporate personas and behind-closed-doors behavior. While these insights are valuable, they often come packaged with meandering tangents about the author's personal struggles - some poignant, others frustratingly lacking self-awareness. Like working while delivering your first child as your husband begs you to stop? Blaming company culture rather than examining personal choices feels like a missed opportunity for deeper reflection.The book's significance extends beyond its content. Meta's heavy-handed legal response - attempting to silence the author through non-disparagement clauses in a severance agreement - demonstrates exactly the kind of corporate bullying that makes this perspective valuable. I purchased multiple copies specifically because of these suppression tactics, and I suspect others will too.Is Wynn-Williams risking too much by potentially violating NDAs to publish these relatively mild revelations? Perhaps. The trillion-dollar company she's battling has deep pockets and thin skin - a dangerous combination. But her voice adds an important dimension to our understanding of an organization that shapes our digital lives.Don't expect earth-shattering revelations that will fundamentally change your view of Meta. Do expect an engaging, sometimes tabloid-adjacent glimpse into the lives of power-drunk tech elites who exemplify that "trifecta of modern cringe" - powerful, wealthy, and entitled. They'll weather this storm easily, but that doesn't make the perspective any less worth reading.
