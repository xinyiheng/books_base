- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2025
- **内容**: The ROI on this book is truly limitless. As someone who already considers themselves a travel expert, well-versed in points, miles, and maximizing rewards, I wasn’t sure how much more I could learn. But How to Win at Travel completely exceeded my expectations.Brian Kelly isn’t just a master at maximizing rewards and winning at travel—he’s also incredibly skilled at breaking down complex topics in a way that’s easy to understand and apply. Travel hacking, elite status strategies, and personal finance tips can often feel overwhelming, but Brian presents everything in a clear, digestible, and engaging way. No jargon, no fluff—just straightforward, actionable advice that anyone can use.Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just starting to explore how to travel smarter, this book is packed with invaluable insights—how to earn and redeem points, protect yourself while traveling, maximize elite status, and much more.But here’s what makes this book a must-buy: Even if you don’t travel often (or at all), there’s still so much value inside. Brian explains how to earn rewards on everyday purchases, optimize your spending, and take advantage of perks you may not even realize exist. This isn’t just a book about travel—it’s a book about making smarter financial decisions that will benefit you for life.It’s a New York Times bestseller for a reason. I genuinely believe everyone should read this book—whether you want to travel better or simply make your money work harder for you. I own both the physical copy and the audiobook (narrated by Brian himself) because the insights are that good, and I want to revisit them again and again.And now? This book has officially become my go-to gift for every occasion—Christmas, birthdays, weddings, you name it. The value packed into these pages is unmatched. If you want to unlock more from your travels, your money, and your life, this is the book to buy.

Without a Single Doubt, a 5 Star read
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025
- **内容**: When I found out Brian Kelly was writing “How to Win at Travel,” I knew I would want it the moment it was published. The book is a great read and more importantly it’s an incredible reference guide, whether you’re a solo traveler or traveling with kids. Brian’s guidance offers the best way to utilize credit card points and miles to make the most out of your travel experience. Without a doubt in my mind, a 5 star read.

Saving me $$$!!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2025
- **内容**: I am 55 pages into this book and it's already saved me $307!! I had a car rental booked in Denver Colorado for 1 week for $651. I had shopped about 3 different sites and comparing prices before I had booked it and at the time thought it was the best deal. However, finding out about Autoslash.com in Brian's book, I plugged in all of the same requirements, same class of vehicle and ended up securing a vehicle for $344!! I have been retired for about 2 years now and have a lot of traveling that I want to do and this book is providing me with a plethora of new information. I always thought I was fairly savvy at this, but this book is providing so much more. I have to highlight info as I go through an also make notes in a separate book to make sure I follow up on all the tricks of the trade. I highly recommend this book....I am not a "reader" but when it comes to saving money, I'm all in on the research and tools.

- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2025
- **内容**: I learned something reading this book, even though I already follow Brian and TPG.  It does a nice job of sharing what to do now with how to roll with industry developments.  Great for the novice as well as for those who are already doing some of this.  Well organized and easy to read.

Smart Travelers!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025
- **内容**: As retirees, and living in south Florida, our favorite hobby/past time is cruising. Luckily there are several cruise lines, itineraries, choices adult focused, family focused, solo travels, what have you! Now, planning for cruises, resorts, expeditions…can be quite costly we have found. However, reading the above published “guide” has enabled us to travel for less by spending our money using credit cards specific to our interests. Marriott Bonvoy cc,Barclay’s American Airlines, cash back BOA have all contributed to free or reduced stays,Airline round trip/one way tickets,Preferred seating, travel protections,WiFi, to name a few perks.It has been a fun learning curve for me educating myself on “smart’ travelwhile at the same time benefiting our retirement funds! Read, Learn and Save!Carpe diem!!!

- **标题**: Good book but…
- **日期**: Reviewed in Canada on February 20, 2025
- **内容**: This is a good book with a lot of information in it as to how to maximize your points and use them efficiently. My beef is that it is geared towards those with elite status who hold millions of miles with credit cards/airlines and not for those of us who are not elite status holders. Also, as a Canadian I skipped through many pages where he writes about America credit cards as this was of no use to me. I recommend if you are a VERY frequent flier who has millions of miles and lives in the USA, otherwise pass on this book.
