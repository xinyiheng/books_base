Kold gives knowledge-very useful and profound on inv.+how to think about qual.of comp.in the process
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2024
- **内容**: I basically enjoyed the hole book, and very happy to have red it. I have red many investing books on bottom up investing, portfolio creation, CFA material, psychology in investing etc.However I see this book as filling a cap about the qualitative side of investing, and how it is related to value.The first two parts (Ch. 1-9) are quite technical and can also be cumbersome, however very useful. It describes thinks that you can have in your checklist to look for regarding a company and quality thereof.In part 3 (Ch. 10-17) the writing and the material is very enticing so it is quickly read and I will read it again soon.Biggest recommendation - but it is not an easy read ;-)

How to evaluate Quality in companies
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2024
- **内容**: Simon Kold does a great job synthesizing everything he's learned over his career about evaluating quality. This includes almost 10 years at Novo Holdings (where he worked directly with the legendary Lou Simpson for 3 weeks).Some of his other influences include Warren & Charlie, Hamilton Helmer, Nick Sleep, and William Thorndike (Outsiders).He outlines concrete ways to analyze quality management, moat, and risk. The table of contents itself gives you a great framework of quality. This is a book I'll be referencing back to whenever I consider the level of "quality" in my own investments.

- **标题**: The definitive book for assessing business quality.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 14, 2024
- **内容**: The book is an essential guide for assessing business quality.  The solid theoretical exposition is illustrated with vivid real-world examples.  Each chapter also includes a section with suggested analytical tests that help empirically evaluate each specific aspect of business quality.  Despite the depth and breadth of the topic, the book is a highly enjoyable read, bearing the stamps of the author’s prior life as a stand-up comedian.

- **评分**: 5.0
- **标题**: Comprehensive guide
- **日期**: Reviewed in Germany on December 7, 2024
- **内容**: I thought this book filled a gap in the market - it covers a wide range of topics illustrating what it means to be a 'high-quality business' AND provides empirical examples to illustrate these topics.I recommend this book to all aspiring analysts hoping to find and invest in such businesses. I also recommend investing time to really think through the questions posed by author - it is time consuming because they are thought provoking, but I think many would learn a great deal from this.Stay away if you're looking for a quick and easy stock tip though, this one isn't for you.
