Excellent and easy-to-read book for everyone
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2024
- **内容**: Approaching The Power of Self-Confidence without any expectations, I was pleasantly surprised by its impactful content. The book is full of practical tips and recommendations that we all should consider applying in our daily lives.I particularly appreciate the concise summaries at the end of each section, which help reinforce the key points and make them easier to remember. Each section is brief yet includes powerful insights that resonate deeply.Maybe the only thing I would add would be a image in the beginning of each chapter. However, I did like some of the images like the one about SMART objective.The author's straightforward writing style makes complex concepts accessible to everyone. I often find myself going back and rereading the same sections to fully absorb the wisdom. For readers who enjoy easy-to-read material filled with useful advice, this book delivers beautifully. It has genuinely helped me boost my self-confidence and approach challenges with a more positive mindset.

Start small and humble, you’ll get there!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2024
- **内容**: This book is written so well for anyone who is struggling with confidence in any way, big or small. The tone is understanding and empathetic, but straight forward and honest. You’ll hear what you need to hear. I especially loved Step 8: Walk before you Run. Stop comparing yourself to where others are and start taking small steps toward our goals. We can control and maintain small changes, then grow from there. I also needed the chapter about how to expect and take criticism, because it’s inevitable - someone at some point is going to criticize you. You shouldn’t be living in fear of it or get defensive about it. Develop the skill to deal with it so it works in your favor.Effective book! Well written! Very helpful!

A transformative guide on building unshakeable self-confidence
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024
- **内容**: "We all want a life full of success, happiness, and fullness." This powerful statement sets the tone for a deeply insightful book that delves into the pivotal role self-confidence plays in achieving a fulfilling life. The author brilliantly captures the essence of why so many people struggle to find sustained success and happiness, highlighting that the root cause often lies within - a lack of confidence in one's own abilities.What I found particularly enlightening is the emphasis on internal versus external factors. The author makes a compelling case that external obstacles are not the primary barriers to success; rather, it is the internal struggle with self-doubt and lack of self-belief that holds many people back. This perspective is not only refreshing but also empowering, as it places the power to change in our own hands.This book is an inspiring read for anyone looking to build their confidence and unlock their true potential. It offers practical insights and actionable advice that can help readers shift their mindset and focus on their strengths rather than their perceived weaknesses. If you're ready to transform your life and achieve the success you desire, this book is a must-read. Highly recommended!

How To Boost Self-Esteem and Build Self-Confidence
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2024
- **内容**: The Power of Self-Confidence by Daniel J. Martin is an excellent essay on how to boost self-esteem and build self-confidence. Author Martin clearly explains the nine steps to accomplish those tasks in an easy-to-read and easy-to-understand way. I was impressed with his summaries at the end of every chapter and his stories to illustrate his steps.  His advice was very practical for every step.  For example, when he discussed his step to "Walk before you run," he suggested starting with "baby steps" to take advantage of the power of simplicity.  This book is more than just building confidence; it's a great book on how to succeed in life.

- **内容**: In general, I liked the book. It offers some great insights and thought-provoking questions. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on acknowledging thoughts from your inner critic and breaking them into categories—something I found novel and hadn't seen before. This approach helped me recognise thoughts I hadn’t realised were overly harsh. Overall, I think it’s a good book with pragmatic suggestions, which the author breaks down into easily implementable and manageable steps. I would recommend it as a read to help lead a more emotionally healthy life.Cute rabbit :)
