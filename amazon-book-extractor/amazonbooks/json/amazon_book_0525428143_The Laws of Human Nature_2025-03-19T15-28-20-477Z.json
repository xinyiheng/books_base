  "description": "From the #1 New York Times-bestselling author of The 48 Laws of Power comes the definitive new book on decoding the behavior of the people around you. This is the only authorized hardcover edition in the US.Robert Greene is a master guide for millions of readers, distilling ancient wisdom and philosophy into essential texts for seekers of power, understanding and mastery. Now he turns to the most important subject of all - understanding people's drives and motivations, even when they are unconscious of them themselves.We are social animals. Our very lives depend on our relationships with people. Knowing why people do what they do is the most important tool we can possess, without which our other talents can only take us so far. Drawing from the ideas and examples of Pericles, Queen Elizabeth I, Martin Luther King Jr, and many others, Greene teaches us how to detach ourselves from our own emotions and master self-control, how to develop the empathy that leads to insight, how to look behind people's masks, and how to resist conformity to develop your singular sense of purpose. Whether at work, in relationships, or in shaping the world around you, The Laws of Human Nature offers brilliant tactics for success, self-improvement, and self-defense.",
  "author_bio": "Robert Greene is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, The 33 Strategies of War, and The 50th Law. His highly anticipated fifth book, Mastery, examines the lives of great historical figures such as Charles Darwin, Mozart, Paul Graham and Henry Ford and distills the traits and universal ingredients that made them masters. In addition to having a strong following within the business world and a deep following in Washington, DC, Greene’s books are hailed by everyone from war historians to the biggest musicians in the industry (including Jay-Z and 50 Cent).Greene attended U.C. Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he received a degree in classical studies. He currently lives in Los Angeles.",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2025",
      "content": "At the time of this review, I'm only halfway through reading this book, but I love it SO much.  I am going after it hardcore with a highlighter and sticky tabs.  I have read over 300 pages (this is a BIG book btw) and have not read a single page that was not worthwhile.This book is easy to comprehend and apply.  I recommend taking your time in digesting it, as the lessons are quite practical in daily life.  It is truly helping me understand myself and others and why we all behave the way we do.Each \"Law\" is a different chapter and the author explains the law, how to recognize it in yourself and others, and how to address such.  He also includes a story about a real person from history and an interesting anecdote that applies to the lesson.  I have never been much of a history buff but these stories are fascinating and therefore I'm learning not only about psychology but history as well.I cannot wait to keep devouring this book.  I would STRONGLY encourage any human being who wants to intentionally become more self-aware and tolerant to read this book.  I will definitely be checking out more books from this author.\nRead more"

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2025",
      "content": "I have read Mastery, The 48 laws of power, The art of seduction, but this has to be one of his best books. I really like how we can see more of his insight  to historical interpretations compare to his other books. I was always left  feeling that I wanted to hear more from his mind rather than a detailed view of the historical people he uses, which are still fun to learn about but I definitely prefer how deep he goes into analyzing human emotions etc. Señor Verde is ahead of his time. When I read his books, especially this one, I feel like I’m reading a classic that will be treasure for the coming generations, hopefully studied at schools. It has taken me some time to read it because of how heavy it is with having to stop and reflect and think if I’m one of these people he warns us about, which we all are, to some extent. Each time I finish a chapter I want to rush and tell my mom, my husband, my cat Nemesis, the world, etc. I hope this book gains more popularity for the sake of all the valuable lessons we can learn from it. Cannot thank Greene enough for the psychological insight he offers at a price of $15! It’s like stumbling into a true diamond that is basically free, where the rest of the world is obsessed with treasuring their zirconium crap.\nRead more"

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2023",
      "content": "Naturally, it was in Robert Greene’s nature to write this book.  Accustomed as he has been to writing about human activity involving power relationships, Greene has produced yet another extraordinary book jam-packed with fascinating insights about how the mind of homo sapiens often works in dealing with other members of the species.As Greene describes in the introduction, this book is a codebook for deciphering people’s behavior, with each chapter telling the story of some iconic individual(s) who illustrates the law being covered, along with advice on how to operate successfully (if that’s possible) under this law.So what laws (all negative aspects or shortcomings, 18 to be exact, of human behavior) does Green focus on in this book?  Irrationality, narcissism, role-playing, compulsive behavior, covetousness, shortsightedness, defensiveness, self-sabotage, repression, envy, grandiosity, gender rigidity, aimlessness, conformity, fickleness, aggression, generational myopia, and death denial.As usual with Greene’s not-inexpensive books, he gives one a lot of ideas and pages to chew on for the money, leaving one well satisfied with the investment.  If I do have any criticisms, the main one relates to the stories he uses to highlight the laws.  Quite often the characterizations are so extensively detailed and intriguing that one can easily forget the law being discussed.  Also, there’s his possible hairsplitting of each of his 18 laws into numerous subcategories, reminding one of the mythical Eskimo vocabulary for the word “snow,” which can get one to question how useful the subcategories are depending upon one’s situation. In addition, some chapters kept me wondering, for example, the one on gender rigidity. Do those things really happen?  This brings up a related general criticism:  a selected bibliography, yes, but no supporting footnotes to back up a few especially dubious, IMHO, assertions.All in all, however, I believe you’ll find the book well-written, enjoyable, and educational as regards important strategies the less-than-honorable portion of the population uses and the strategies the more honorable can use to successfully counter.Of possible consideration for those interested in a book distilling five main life strategies from 87 of history’s master strategists: Strategic Advantage: How to Win in War, Business, and Life\nRead more"
