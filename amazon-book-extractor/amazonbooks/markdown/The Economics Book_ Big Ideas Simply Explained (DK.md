DK-Ecomomics - another Giant of Knowledge
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2021
- **内容**: DK-Ecomomics - another Giant of KnowledgeHappy to have found DK, this fantastic source of knowlwdge, after having perused Philosophy and Politics, I grabbed my own speciality Economics, and, indeed, was not disappointed! As retired professor of economics I expected to find a repeating course of everything I had learned and lectured, written during my career. And I really found it, but not only that, but a giant wide background of it, of course the nucleus of my knowledge but also a thick layer around it, up to thick but not dense layer of unknown but interesting items.Everything here is presented in the new revolutionary DK-way completely permeated by dense internal linkage to such an extent that it can without the least exaggeration be named a new genre, new at least to me, although I have read only ebooks already during the last five years and can consider myself a specialist in textbooks having myself published 27 editions of mainly textbooks, all in paper format. Now fingers are itching to get at least one of my obliterate, because of their strong fresh econometric foundation, texts transformed to this DK format. The same concerning my two present translations from Russian to English and Finnish, both two being particularly suitable for rich internal linking, one of them already having that to large extent as well as the discoursive spirit of the text being lented to this easy-learning way. Good bye thick hand-written notes for exam preparation tags. Of course, own hand-written has its advantages compared with ready-made author-prepared, but so have the latter, too, like automobiles over horsebuggies.What is then particular in this DK Economics? Absolutely the topmost is the feature that every time a person, an authority is mentioned, the name is made a link to he or she being mentied elsewhere in this book, to peronal profile or to contribution to the topic now in question. You can, according to need and interest, look up or pass this link. Anyway, you cannot avoid paying notice to the frequency of a name in the text. It soon becomes clear that Adam Smith and Keynes are the real heroes of this book, quite rightly so, also in my opinion. It seems to me that in addition to all the real classics, almost all Economics Nobel Price winners get this honorifying link treatment. Except, to my astonishment, my favorite econometrician L.R. Klein. Why my favorite? Because my personal contact with him.  Even if by a few hanshakes, but two terms of listening his lectures in Penn Uni and reading his widely popular book of The Keynesian Revolution and most importantof all having learned through his famous Klein's Kit booklet the main tool for my life's work, te Iterative Solution of a Macroeconomic Models. Indeed, Klein would have deserved being mentioned in this DK Economics along with Tinbergen and Frish, especially as econometrics as such gets a fair attention, for its significance in general, although none of its core principles, also a small disappointment. But all main doctrines and connections of economics as science and economic policies are profoundly treated in logical as well as their intuitive origins by personal flying wordings of the authors.When reading about the myriades of the more dimmed stars, I come to the idea that this is even too much, a whole encyclopedia even for serious professionals. Something thinner, perhaps a half or even a third of the present would be needed for newcomers, studying youth as well as interested amateurs or practical representatives of business and administration. Therefore suggestion to publishers: Why not edit a shorter version before somebody else does it? I am convinced that the loss in pages brings a gain in readers and would not disappoint in sales either.Anyway: full five stars assessment with laurel wreath!

Approachable, relevant, and up-to-date. Probably equivalent to taking Econ 101.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2025
- **内容**: If you want a cliff-notes version of the modern economy and how we got here, this book is a worthy guide. The structure of the book is engaging: broken into short, approachable topics, full of infographics, and broken up by biographies. The authors do a great job of explaining big ideas simply, as advertised. Unfortunately, the best they can do in these 2-4 page summaries is sketch an outline of an economic theory, contrasting contradictory theories without resolving the dichotomy (if such resolution exists).

Very Nice Resource and Handier than Wikipedia
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2019
- **内容**: I've looked for a simple economics history book for decades. I bought the Kindle edition for listening and underlining key concepts. As a sociology major 45 years ago, my economics interests revolved around Malthus and Marx; so, naturally enough, these two thinkers were first on my reading list. Simple explanations for some of their key concepts find fair handling, I believe.I sometimes wonder how Marx would appear today had he delved into ecology as a critical concept as we find it today.  Marx's ideas would have benefitted from George Perkins Marsh's work on nature, for example. I'm thinking of the commodification of our planet as private property and the new attacks on the Amazon forests and CO2 density increases.  Exxon, of course, comes to mind as proof of capitalism's moral dilemmas; its embrace of moral corruption as a get rich now scheme at the cost of future generations. Anyway, this little book should help young students increase their economics literacy. KillerOceans.Com - eddie evans

Not in-depth about math, otherwise excellent
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2013
- **内容**: The book gives a lot of theoretical abstractions, demonstrating them with non-numeric graphs.Many clear and concise topic areas are introduced, some of which were unfamiliar to me, and many for which I could not place a source, for example, industrial age and renaissance theorists who reached the conclusion that 'the last chocolate in a box is less valuable than the first' and 'labor seeks to justify it's own redundance' and many others.The book helped me to locate economists who are frequently hard to locate in the literature.This is better than a lot of introductory texts, and the number of theories covered is volumetric.

- **标题**: Why using flashcards when you have a book like this one
- **日期**: Reviewed in Italy on January 15, 2023
- **内容**: I’ve read some comments saying “it doesn’t provide you with much information” well, I might have the answer to that.this book was not meant to profoundly teach you everything about economics. And I use the word profoundly for a reason.You forgot what Ricardo’s take on international trade was? You’re not sure who was the first economist who used math to prove economic theories? What about the physiocrats?There you go, just like a big bunch of study flashcards put together. Well-written, with graphs and charts, timelines of events, and biographies.The book cover the most important topics, theories, authors, thinkers, and events related to the subject.
