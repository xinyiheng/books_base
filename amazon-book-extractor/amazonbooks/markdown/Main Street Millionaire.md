| 作者简介 | Codie Sanchez is a formidable force in the world of finance, known for her bold, contrarian thinking, financial acumen and entrepreneurial prowess.Codie’s parents, a special education teacher and a self-made blue-collar builder, taught Codie the value of education and ownership. They inspired her to build her own future.After graduating early from Arizona State University with a degree in journalism, Codie traveled to Juarez, Mexico to document the atrocities there. Her coverage earned her the Robert F. Kennedy Award for print journalism. It also taught her that people must have financial resources and education to change their future. That’s when Codie switched from journalism to finance. In 2008, Codie took her first job at Vanguard, right before the financial crisis struck. Once again, she witnessed the devastating impact of financial illiteracy on ordinary people. She dedicated herself to learning how to earn more money so she could help others do the same. Over the next several years, Codie continued to master the financial world, climbing the ranks at Goldman Sachs, State Street, and First Trust. But she never forgot her blue-collar entrepreneurial roots. She began to buy, build and invest in an array of businesses, like laundromats and cannabis companies, creating a diverse investment portfolio.Then, after mastering the language of finance, dealmaking, mergers and acquisitions, Codie began empowering and educating others to do the same. In 2020, when a global pandemic brought the world to a standstill, Codie launched Contrarian Thinking, the world’s first free-thinking finance and media company. In just a few short years, Contrarian Thinking has empowered thousands worldwide to take control of their financial destinies and become successful small business owners. |

A Good To Great for buying into business ownership
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2025
- **内容**: This book is an absolute gem. Despite being a seasoned private equity professional who has acquired/invested in businesses for the past 16 years, I couldn't put this book down after I opened it. It is a one-of-a-kind blend between a guide to dealmaking for Main Street businesses, a collection of the best small business management principles, and a practical guide to financial freedom through business ownership.From the very first chapter, Codie masterfully makes a case for a realistic path to financial independence through buying and running small businesses. This path is attainable to most job holders in corporate America. She then proceeds to demystify the whole process of acquiring and managing a small business with well-articulated and clear concepts. Her writing is to the point, witty, interspersed with the exact amount of F-bombs you would expect from an entrepreneur's voice and highly motivational... in short, in true entrepreneur-style!Some concepts will be a bit hard to grasp entirely for readers who have never been close to the world of acquisitions. However, Codie makes sure to point them to other resources (including to her Contrarian Thinking community - after all, she is building a media empire on top of her investment holding).Codie also does a fantastic job of distilling many key business growth and management concepts taught across business school campuses. She transforms these into easy-to-remember checklists and frameworks, without ever dumbing them down. She is generous with real-life examples, not only for illustration purposes but also ones that every reader can relate to.There is definitely a lot to unpack in this DIY guide to being a millionaire. I think the readers who will make the most of this fun, quick yet very informative read are precisely the budding entrepreneur-owners. They will use this book as a travel map to guide and personalize their own successful business ownership journey. To have authored such a practicable, illuminating and enjoyable guide is no easy feat. Codie, I tip my hat to you as I highly recommend this book.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Not Hyperbole: More Valuable than an MBA
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2025
- **内容**: Codie has taken decades of experience, including her successes and her mistakes, and brilliantly distilled it into 250 pages that offer succinct yet comprehensive PRACTICAL teaching on such a vast and nuanced topic.She lays out a framework that is simple to understand, replete with examples throughout that are perfectly relevant. She recognizes and identifies the hurdles that up-and-coming owners will face, and provides resources that are more than worth the price of the book.My favorite aspect of the book, however, is how it is so definitively written in her voice, complete with the tongue-in-cheek sarcastic humor that has endeared her to so many on her social platforms. Made it an easy and enjoyable read. Educational and inspiring, entertaining and motivational, and highly recommended for anyone getting introduced to the idea of small business ownership and anyone who believes in her noble vision.

A great mix of "how-to" and real stories from an author that has "been there, done that"
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2025
- **内容**: As someone who has successfully built four start-ups from scratch, and been an operating executive for PE backed companies, I am often skeptical of the many supposed "experts" touting business ownership as an easy path to wealth. Codie does a terrific job of providing credibility to both her successes and mistakes along the journey to buying and building businesses. She correctly admits that it takes high effort, but can be very rewarding. Consistent with her style, she doesn't sugar coat anything and provides great tactical as well as strategic insights into how to seek out and execute transactions while minimizing risk.Codie is spot on relative to the opportunity of the next few years as millions of business owners look to cash out, and her perspective of approaching deals under the radar of the PE firms is the right target for most individual investors.Lastly, her book provides real and actionable advice, rather than providing a sales pitch for her other services. Whether you are looking for your first business acquisition, or a seasoned industry veteran, this book has something for every business owner.

- **内容**: This book is an eye opener. Teaches us how to start, run and sell a business. It’s the only book you will need if you want to start a business and ditch your good employer. Don’t be an educated fool that is underappreciated at work. Take a dip in the world of ownership. Thank you Codie.

- **内容**: Codie Sanchez has done a great job, as an entrepreneur, investor, and advocate for unconventional investing methods. In this book she describes very well how to build wealth by investing in small, often-overlooked "Main Street" businesses instead of the traditional Wall Street avenues. The book not only emphasizes the potential for wealth creation by acquiring "boring" but profitable small businesses, but goes as far as to identify right businesses, financing acquisitions, operational management; she includes real-life examples of individuals who achieved financial freedom using her strategies. The step-by-step nature of the book makes it actionable for beginners. And with her multiple Stories of success, she provides inspiration and relatability. Mrs. Sanchez's tone is approachable, blending humor, candor, and expertise. The focus on small businesses as an alternative investment avenue is refreshing and underexplored. Some readers might find the focus on "boring" businesses unappealing initially.While actionable, parts of the book may oversimplify complex processes, like securing financing or managing acquisitions. Personally this book and Codie's ideas and expertise have definitely changed my perspective on wealth-building or entrepreneurship.  I now feel inspired to explore "Main Street" investment opportunities and I am seriously considering them. The book is must-read for aspiring entrepreneurs, investors, or those seeking financial freedom. I believe that those would benefit most from this book are small business owners, first-time investors, and people who I have no idea where to start with wealth acquisitions. Well done Codie!!!

- **内容**: "Main Street Millionaire" by Codie Sanchez is one of the most practical and inspiring books I have read in recent years. Having already followed Codie's video content, I was excited to dive into the book—and it did not disappoint. What sets this book apart is how it provides actionable examples of real businesses and their financial breakdowns, giving readers a solid reference for understanding cash flow and acquisitions.As a UK resident, I found the ideas and examples from U.S.-based businesses applicable and adaptable here. The book provides strategies for acquiring and managing local businesses and emphasises their importance to the local community and economy. This resonates deeply with me as I aim to transition from being a solo IT consultant to acquiring and growing cash-flowing local businesses that contribute positively to my community.Overall, this book is an excellent resource for anyone looking to enter the small business acquisition field, whether they're a complete beginner or have some experience. Codie's insights and the book's straightforward, approachable style make it a must-read for anyone serious about creating wealth through small businesses. Highly recommended!

- **内容**: Amazing book! Filled with valuable information and, at the same time, very easy to read. It really opened my mind to a new way of seeing the world and being a creator of wealth for me and those around me instead of a victim. I come from a country where very rich politicians have told us that wealth is bad and what we should aim for is a monthly check from the state. The information in this book has helped me see the light, definitely will be sharing it with everyone I know, hopefully we'll be more fulfilled, freer and richer :) Also, Codie's YouTube channel is full of case studies and information that expands on what she explains in the book, so I feel like I've gone through an SMB acquisition course for the cost of 30eur. This book has opened my appetite for learning about what businesses exist in my country and what would be the best fit for me. Thanks for such a great book :)
