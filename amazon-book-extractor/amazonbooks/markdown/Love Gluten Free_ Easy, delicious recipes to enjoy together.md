- **内容**: My daughter is Coeliac and this book really got her interested in picking meals, food ideas and things to make. Anything that makes her gluten free diet more fun and interesting is a big deal in my eyes.We've loved trying recipes from this book... we've tried a few already and are really enjoying everything we've made. The butter chicken and crispy Mallow Bars have gone down a storm.Our only very small niggle and a note for further booms is having some clearer ideas of how long each recipe might take so that when you're selecting recipes it's clearer how long they take. That's our only improvement however... we're hooked!
