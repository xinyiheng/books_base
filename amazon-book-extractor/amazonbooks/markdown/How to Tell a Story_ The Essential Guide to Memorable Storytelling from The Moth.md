- **标题**: Attractive headline and blurb, but contents a bit stretched out
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 September 2023
- **内容**: I was captured by the description of the book when reading the blurb. Upon starting it, I read the first three chapters and didn't learn anything that was promised in the description. Maybe it is still coming, but I am not very motivated to read further.

- **日期**: Reviewed in Australia on 6 October 2023
- **内容**: Despite its promising blurb, the book proved to be a considerable waste of time. It fell short of delivering the creative spark and valuable insights I had anticipated. Instead of offering fresh perspectives on storytelling or profound anecdotes to fuel the imagination, it was largely a collection of underwhelming narratives that failed to inspire. For authors hoping to find a wellspring of creativity, "The Moth" regrettably falls short and might leave you searching for a more enriching source of inspiration.
