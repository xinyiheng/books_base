| 内容简介 | Since its first publication, Michael J. Mauboussin's popular guide to wise investing has been translated into eight languages and has been named best business book by BusinessWeek and best economics book by Strategy+Business. Now updated to reflect current research and expanded to include new chapters on investment philosophy, psychology, and strategy and science as they pertain to money management, this volume is more than ever the best chance to know more than the average investor.Offering invaluable tools to better understand the concepts of choice and risk, More Than You Know is a unique blend of practical advice and sound theory, sampling from a wide variety of sources and disciplines. Mauboussin builds on the ideas of visionaries, including Warren Buffett and E. O. Wilson, but also finds wisdom in a broad and deep range of fields, such as casino gambling, horse racing, psychology, and evolutionary biology. He analyzes the strategies of poker experts David Sklansky and Puggy Pearson and pinpoints parallels between mate selection in guppies and stock market booms. For this edition, Mauboussin includes fresh thoughts on human cognition, management assessment, game theory, the role of intuition, and the mechanisms driving the market's mood swings, and explains what these topics tell us about smart investing.More Than You Know is written with the professional investor in mind but extends far beyond the world of economics and finance. Mauboussin groups his essays into four parts-Investment Philosophy, Psychology of Investing, Innovation and Competitive Strategy, and Science and Complexity Theory-and he includes substantial references for further reading. A true eye-opener, More Than You Know shows how a multidisciplinary approach that pays close attention to process and the psychology of decision making offers the best chance for long-term financial results. |

Brain food on board the Process Train
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2006
- **内容**: The essays in Michael J. Mauboussin's book, More than  You Know,  Finding Financial Wisdom in  Unconventional Places, are grouped into four categories:  Investment  Philosophy, Psychology of Investing, Innovation and  Competitive Strategy, and  Science and Complexity Theory.Reading those essays is like following a treasure-strewn wisdom trail.  Mauboussin spreads the trail with tastybits of knowledge accumulated from many different disciplines, and like a hungry  tracker, I follow as he leads me from the insights of Warren Buffett to the  strategies of poker theorist David Sklansky, to Tupperware parties and  Tiger Woods's golf swing. Along the way, I notice what makes "fitness," in thesense of Darwin's survival of the fittest, a likely  outcome, be it in investing, sports or in evolution itself.Reading this book is also like a welcome ride aboard a process train. Looking out at the landscape, I see the connections between various disciplines, and a world shared  by those who for the moment are the "fittest" and those who have been left behind. Mauboussin offers us success stories plus a non- threatening view of various psychological and ecological traps to avoid.This trip offers insights into the human ability to make decisions within the framework of a  system--a family system, a business system, whatever system you live and work in.  And it points to a future when, perhaps, there will be more wisdom and less pressure. After all, we humans do care about the future-- especially when it comes to choosing mates, raising children and, oh yeah, being rich and powerful or even compassionate. Our personal lives and our investment strategies are dependent on how well we understand systems, and how well we understand systems is central to how we make the decisions that we do.Understanding relationships--the very stuff of any system--leads to the ability to predict and even influence future outcomes. I have learned this as a family systems therapist and (in the spirit of openness) to some extent by being Michael  Mauboussin's mother-in-law.As I've listened to people seeking to discover how  to be better leaders or better parents, or just trying to be a bit more separate  from their peer groups, I have seen knowledge about natural process in systems just calm people down. Suddenly, the blame game is over. People realize that there are big forces in the systems they inhabit that are pressuring them to remain on Shakespeare's stage, playing a part that may not be the role they would choose for themselves. And often suddenly, they realize that they do, in fact, have a choice.Magic happens when the brain opens up. And this book is brain food for students of human nature looking for insights into natural forces. Mauboussin understands the need we humans have for "profound knowledge." He points us in a new direction as he gathers wisdom from every corner, and adds value to our lives by showing just how important "profound knowledge" reallyis. Remember E.  Edwards Deming? His system of profound knowledge was to combine tons of information from outside the system with usable feedback from relationships within the system. In Out of the Crisis (1986), written after Deminghad proven his management method by bringing  the Japanese into the Industrial Age, Deming noted that, "Long-term commitment  to new learning and new philosophy is required of any management that seeks transformation. The timid andthe fainthearted, and the people who expect quick results, are doomed to disappointment."Mauboussin looks carefully at the results of research by science author, W. Brian Arthur and others, and shows why we need more than one simple way to understand or visualize future outcomes.  Inductive vs. deductive reasoning, forexample, describes neither the options available nor the total problem. Understanding the power of expectation and feedback might be useful, but never leave out what happens toyour brain when you are enjoying your family, or when you are in the middle of the rushof Mr. Market.Mauboussin also discusses the problem of wanting to be part of the crowd while at the same time needing to stand alone. Overcoming the deep need to be one with the group can free us as thinkers and give us the strength to make thewise decisions that set us apart from the group. On the other hand, most of the time the group can give us better answers than the local guru. Nonetheless, autonomy is a much needed ingredient for the group itself to be wise.  The blind spots in the brain are fascinating and deserve every bit of space Mauboussin gives them.Another piece of  evidence that was psychologically noteworthy, in the section titled,  The Mind  Makes A Promise that the Body Can't Fill,  Mauboussin notes, "The research in Creative Destruction and Stall Points is that an inability to  innovate and grow is the result of largely controllable organizational and  strategic factors."  Frightening that people are the main problem in their corporation's inability to sustain growth. There is a lot to learn about the human forces inside systems. It is also humbling to learn from this book that understanding the math behind long-term  value still does not give people the courage to stand apart from the market to  make financially wise decisions.  I think I have been there.Perhaps only by understanding the power of the natural forces inside systems can we become better at resisting the pull of the crowd and the trend.  Do I need more than this book to increase my determination to strive for more autonomy, diversity and deep wisdom?Diversity, Mauboussin notes, is key to keeping markets balanced and avoiding cycles of boom and bust. But this always requires knowledgeable individuals willing to stand alone to make those "diverse" decisions. Decisions that are reactions to what the group wants or compensation for the past are the result of natural processes and do not always produce the best outcome. Booms and busts are also reactive, as is restricting autonomy in markets, families and work systems. Embracing that warm feeling of certainty by just "going along" seems to weave a dim future.This is a fun but deep book for anyone who wants to understand the workings of natural processes  and how blind we can be as we try to make thoughtful decisions. But for those of you who want to believe this book is only for investors motivated to take a good swing at the future by enthusiastically embracing the diversity of  knowledge--well, that's okay too.

Extremely interesting
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2006
- **内容**: Mauboussin is chief investment strategist for Legg Mason, and formerly he was with Credit Suisse First Boston.  I stumbled on some of his materials a year or so ago, and I've also read "Expectations Investing," another excellent book that he co-wrote with Michael Rappaport.This is not a "how to" book, and readers looking for simple methods to apply in a quest for achieving wealth would be better served by looking elsewhere.  Rather, the underlying theme of the book is that knowledge garnered in a variety of disciplines can help investors understand stock price movements and (hopefully) protect investors from common errors.  Stated otherwise, the book provides insights into how to improve the investing thought process - it does not provide insights into how to analyze a particular company.There are some real gems in this book.  For example, Mauboussin cites Babe Ruth to emphasize the point that an investor does not necessarily win by being right more often than wrong (Babe Ruth certainly struck out a lot).  He points out that what really counts is the magnitude of the wins versus the losses (e.g., Ruth sure hit a lot of home runs).As many investors are aware, mutual funds tend to underperform passive indexes.  Some funds, however, have historically beaten those indexes.  As someone who has followed that issue somewhat, I particularly enjoyed the chapter on "The Hot Hand in Investing," which aptly concludes that "long streaks are extraordinary luck imposed on great skill."I found this book to be particularly interesting when read after "Expectations Investing," as it fleshes out the reason for the themes set forth in that work.  Simply stated, Mauboussin believes that, in the aggregate, the stock market does a good job in aggregating information (See the Chapter on "From Honey to Money").  In this respect, he differs from Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett, who feel that the market tends to be fairly irrational over the short run.Even where individuals are irrational, the aggregate market itself is not because investors are heterogeneous.  However, there may be times when investors are not heterogeneous, in which case the market may be prone to excesses.  Certainly, anyone who remembers the dot com bubble can relate to that point, and even see it with respect to particular company's at any given time.Mauboussin's views appear to be diametrically opposed to some other well known investors.  For example, the contrasts between "More than What You Know" and the view of David Dremen in "Contrarian Investing" are quite notable.  Readers who enjoy this book might want to take a look at Dremen's work to see another view point (more closely aligned to Graham and Buffett).Another well-known investor who takes positions that are somewhat different than Mauboussin is Marty Whitman, in his books "Value Investing" and "The Aggressive Conservative Investor."  Where Mauboussin focuses on how Wall Street values stocks, Whitman emphasizes that different people may have a very different outlook and objectives with respect to stocks.  Thus, Whitman essentially "arbitrages" market prices against the values these different people may have (example: a firm may have a private value that exceeds its public value - something that adherents of the "random walk" theory, and possibly Mouboussin, don't acknowledge).  I found the difference in views between these two authors to be particularly informative.In all, this book provides an excellent way for investors to avoid errors that others have made and will continue to make.  The point of the book is simple: by paying attention to the decision-making process, investors can make better choices to improve their long-term results.

- **标题**: Food for thought
- **日期**: Reviewed in Germany on June 12, 2019
- **内容**: One of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read. It is a compendium of self-standing essays, many of which contain summaries of other works, but apply them to stock market investing. Even though most terms are explained, I wouldn't recommend the book for someone who does not posses an understanding of basic financial terms like volatility, Sharpe's ratio etc.. In part, this text is a criticism of the short-term orientation of most active investors. In summary, it delivers a mixture of already-known concepts and new ways of thinking/food for thought. The book is written in the style of paper, which means you can find and deep-dive into all of the author's references.

- **内容**: Mauboussin shows again and again benefits of multidisciplinary thinking in investing. Various disciplines Mauboussin draws his investing ideas include cognitive psychology, probability, neuroscience, network theory, and complexity. If you like Nassim Taleb, Benoit Mandelbrot, or James Montier, you will like this book. Each chapter beings concise and independent, the book is recommended even to the busiest of practitioners.
