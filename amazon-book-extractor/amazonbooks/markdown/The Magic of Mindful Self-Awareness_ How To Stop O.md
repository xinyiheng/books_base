- **内容**: What an easy read on such an impactful topic. So grateful to Matt for sharing his experiences, knowledge, and hope with the world (particularly during a time when we really need it!). The tools in the book are presented in such an approachable way, not intimidating at all (which is impressive for such a challenging topic). I'm really grateful to have this in my personal library now and will continue to reference it when I need these gentle reminders.

An Inspiring Guide to Lasting Peace and Awareness
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2025
- **内容**: The Magic of Mindful Self-Awareness is an engaging guide to understanding and practicing mindfulness in a way that feels both transformative and approachable.In recent years, interest in mindfulness and meditation has grown significantly, but many people find it challenging to maintain the habit. We often feel as though we are “failing” at the practice or find ourselves overwhelmed by stress, anxiety, and negative thought patterns, making it difficult to dedicate time to our practice.Tenney addresses these common challenges directly, providing a straightforward, step-by-step process that anyone can adopt to enjoy the many benefits mindfulness offers.What truly sets this book apart is Tenney's personal narrative, which is woven throughout its pages.His extraordinary life journey—from spending time in prison to living as a monk, and now as a socially conscious entrepreneur—adds depth, authenticity, and inspiration to his teachings. His storytelling is engaging and illustrates the transformative power of mindfulness when applied in real-world situations.Readers will find this book both practical and uplifting. It is ideal for anyone seeking to break free from the overwhelm of stress and self-doubt and begin experiencing the lasting peace and clarity that mindfulness can provide.

Good start for mindfulness beginners
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2025
- **内容**: For anyone new to mindfulness, I'd say this is a decent place to start. Absolutely fantastic opening. The story pulled me in quickly. After that, though, it slowed down much too much for me. This is a book about mindfulness so it isn't meant to be a page-turner so maybe I set my expectations too after getting pulled in.Worth the read to gain an understanding and start a practice of mindfulness.

Must read! Helps with how to stop overthinking and be happy.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025
- **内容**: Everyone should read this book!For those whose overthinking often involves negative or anxious thoughts, this book is a must read. It's a short and easy-to-read book that teaches you about mindful self-awareness and how to manage thoughts.Once I started reading it, I could not put it down. The way the author uses stories to explain how our thoughts are the cause of our suffering and then gives you examples, ideas, and actionable steps to take to learn how to let passing thoughts come and go and to live in the moment is the best part of the book.Everyone should read this book if they want to be happy and learn to live in the moment. It's easier said than done but the book gives pretty good guidance on how we can achieve this by letting our thoughts just be and teaches you about how the mind is a powerful thing.Highly recommend this book.

Focus on now
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2025
- **内容**: My mind runs like a hamster on a wheel.  It seems never to stop.  While this is sometimes useful for problem solving, it's not so useful when I'm thinking about problems that aren't even real problems.I immediately read chapters 1 - 4 as soon as I purchased this Kindle book.  Already, my mindset has changed.  I now notice my surroundings more and this practice allows me to focus more on the specific task at hand versus being distracted by my negative thoughts.  I feel much more relaxed and much more productive. I expect to improve my mental and physical health with the practices I have learned from this author and his experiences.
