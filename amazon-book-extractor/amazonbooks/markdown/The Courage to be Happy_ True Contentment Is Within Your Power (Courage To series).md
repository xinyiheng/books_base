- **内容**: This book is certainly more difficult to process than its prequel, but it follows through the ideas presented there, giving a firm foundation to the philosophy and the tools we need to live by it. It's taken me some time to get through this book, and now I have finished, I certainly feel like saying goodbye to a trusty teacher who has now finished his job and set me on my way. I feel sad and excited at the same time, and I feel hopeful, knowing it's far from being too late for me, and getting like a master rather than a slave of my destiny. It's scary and good, and likely also reinforced by the fact that my finishing the book coincided with my finishing a course of CBT. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who needs a bit of hope and guidance. If you have the patience and prepared to make a change, it'll certainly be worth your time.

- **内容**: This is a strong sequel to the bestselling “The Courage to Be Disliked”. That book set out the broad themes of Adlerian psychology. This book takes some of those themes further in terms of childrearing, education and how education is structured and ultimately love.Definitely worth reading after you’ve read “The Courage to Be Disliked”.

- **标题**: Sequal to "Courage to be Disliked", helps clarify a number of ideas. Adlerian Psycology.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2021
- **内容**: Book clarifies and extends some ideas in presented.in the first book "The Courage to be Disliked".The format is essentially the same..dialogue between Philosoper and froend/student..but.after three years the student is dismayed with trying to apply the ideas from the first book, and seeks to debate his mentor once more.The subjects of respect, praise, and encouragement are debated in more detail, as well as love, and the variety of relationship types in.the first book - particularly via the vehicle of a teachers relationship with and his students, and couples/interpersonal/love relationships.The book touches on themes like the need for recognition, or to be special, and I particularly found a small section talking about counselling, and a three faced column, and "heros" or saviours very interesting.There's quite a bit of discussion around community, and having the courage to contribute /give to others...hence the title. Perhaps that's what people read sometimes when they say "paying forward".The discussion around love, commitment, families and independence was also very insightful.Excellent.

- **标题**: This is an entertaining philosophical take on modern CBT.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2025
- **内容**: The calm voice of the ‘teacher’ sounds like how you would chat up AI. I was imagining slapping his face just to see his reaction, some emotion. I understand why this is a Japanese writer, Japanese are the most repressed and stoic people out there. Which is why they are dying out, their culture has become pure Logos with a horrible collective shadow of sexual depravities. Of course there are good ones, like Kurosawa.

- **标题**: Brilliant sequel to Courage to be Disliked
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2019
- **内容**: The ideas in this book really resonate with me. Notions such as 'you can't be happy unless you're self reliant', 'we all have in us the desire for community feeling' and 'it's through loving another that you get to the point of community feeling for more people'.All the ideas tie together near the end, and form a basis for thinking which is not just empty, but actionable.Highly recommend. It's useful (but not vital) to read the first book 'Courage to be Disliked' first. These two books are the first books I'd rate as 10 out of 10, in a long time!

- **标题**: A powerful read
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2020
- **内容**: An excellent read that greatly expands on the courage to be disliked book, which is best read first. The discourse between the two protagonists continues similar to the previous, but now delves much deeper into the core elements of Adler's philosophy. Providing a very satisfactory read for all people looking for further  ideas on self improvement and fulfilment.
