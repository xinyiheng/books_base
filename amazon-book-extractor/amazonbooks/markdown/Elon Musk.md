| 内容简介 | The #1 New York Times and global bestseller from Walter Isaacson—the acclaimed author of Steve Jobs, Einstein: His Life and World, Benjamin Franklin, and Leonardo da Vinci—is the astonishingly intimate story of the most fascinating, controversial innovator of modern times. For two years, Isaacson shadowed Elon Musk as he executed his vision for electric vehicles at Tesla, space exploration with SpaceX, the AI revolution, and the takeover of Twitter and its conversion to X. The result is the definitive portrait of the mercurial pioneer that offers clues to his political instincts, future ambitions, and overall worldview.When Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist. His father’s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission, and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive. At the beginning of 2022—after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth—Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. “I need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,” he said. It was a wistful comment, not a New Year’s resolution. Even as he said it, he was secretly buying up shares of Twitter, the world’s ultimate playground. Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground. For two years, Isaacson shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his factories with him, and spent hours interviewing him, his family, friends, coworkers, and adversaries. The result is the revealing inside story, filled with amazing tales of triumphs and turmoil, that addresses the question: are the demons that drive Musk also what it takes to drive innovation and progress? |

The General George Patton of Tech!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025
- **内容**: Here the author is writing in the first person after a two-year stint with Elon Musk which provides a very interesting view into the richest man's life from birth to the present day.  Isaacson performs a similar feat to the bibliography he previously printed for Steve Jobs (in fact Musk is occasionally compared to Jobs).  The product is designed to my liking with short chapters in a chronological order allowing the reader to transverse swiftly through the manuscript.  Even though the book is an easy read, it is difficult in one sitting.With this structure Isaacson rivets the reader to the story by moving back and forth thru the many business ventures and personal issues in the Musk life.  Here he has interviewed most of the individuals that have touched on Elon Musk's life with many in direct quotes.  The piece is a long "beach read" for it spans the initiation and development of: Tesla, Space X, The Boring Company, Neurolink, and recently Twitter all in the pursuit of a Mars landing and colonization.Throughout the book the reader will be treated to inside matters of Musk's decisions regarding the above companies and his personal life.  What is very noteworthy is in Chapters 80-83 how Musk takes over Twitter and later how he culls the employee force by 75% with the company still functioning.  This may be a preview of how DOGE will be recommending the modification of the US civil service workforce.As with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic America has not seen anyone the likes of Elon Musk since "Mr. Fix-It," Herbert Hoover, also an engineer by training.  Fortunately, Musk is not able to be president of the USA.  This book portrays a forward looking visionary similar to the Portuguese "Henry the Navigator" with the persistence and determination of General George Patton.  This vison coupled with determination will lead mankind off our planet where your grandchildren will be mining asteroids in the future.The product is well structured with a table of contents bearing ninety-five chapters with references and notes.  It has a very helpful index, and black and white photos accompany each chapter.  The timeline ends in April 2023 after the SpaceX Starship launch.  Purchase this if you desire to view the American Dream!

- **内容**: É um livro grande, mas que permanece interessante do começo ao fim. Nunca perde o ritmo. Ao terminar cada capítulo, dá vontade de ler o seguinte. Li poucos livros na vida com tanta rapidez. Na minha visão, o autor não passa pano para o Elon Musk, e deixa bem claros os enormes problemas psicológicos dele, mostrando ao mesmo tempo a capacidade que ele tem de trabalhar e fazer as coisas acontecerem.
