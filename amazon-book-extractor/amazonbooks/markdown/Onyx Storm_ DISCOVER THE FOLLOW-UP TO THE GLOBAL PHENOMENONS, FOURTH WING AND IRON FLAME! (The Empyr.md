| 内容简介 | DON'T BE THE LAST TO DISCOVER THE SERIES THAT EVERYONE CAN'T STOP TALKING ABOUT: Get ready for the breathtaking follow-up to global phenomenons Fourth Wing and Iron Flame from the no. 1 Sunday Times and New York Times bestselling author Rebecca Yarros. ARE YOU READY TO BRAVE THE DARK? After nearly eighteen months at Basgiath War College, Violet Sorrengail knows there's no more time for lessons. No more time for uncertainty. Because the battle has truly begun, and with enemies closing in from outside their walls and within their ranks, it's impossible to know who to trust. Now Violet must journey beyond the failing Aretian wards to seek allies from unfamiliar lands to stand with Navarre. The trip will test every bit of her wit, luck, and strength, but she will do anything to save what she loves - her dragons, her family, her home, and him. Even if it means keeping a secret so big, it could destroy everything. They need an army. They need power. They need magic. And they need the one thing only Violet can find - the truth. But a storm is coming... and not everyone can survive its wrath.

- **内容**: Rebecca Yarros has done it again with Onyx Storm, the thrilling follow-up to Fourth Wing and Iron Flame. This installment takes readers on an unforgettable journey that combines high-stakes action, emotional depth, and jaw-dropping revelations.The character development in this book is exceptional, particularly for Violet Sorrengail. She has grown into a fierce, determined protagonist, and her journey is as inspiring as it is heart-wrenching. Her strength, intelligence, and vulnerability shine in equal measure, making her one of my favorite characters in recent fantasy fiction.And then there’s Xaden. What can I say? He remains an irresistible force, a character so compelling that no twist or revelation could diminish my love for him. His dynamic with Violet continues to sizzle, adding layers of tension and tenderness to the story.Surprisingly, Dain’s arc also left me reflecting. While he’s made questionable choices, this book hints that he might deserve a second chance—a testament to Yarros’ ability to craft multi-dimensional characters.The plot is packed with new information, unveiling more about the world and its magic. However, just when I thought I had a grasp on things, Yarros dropped even more unanswered questions, leaving me desperate for the next book.And the ending—oh, the ending! While I had a feeling something big was coming, I was still left stunned. It was the perfect mix of heartbreak and exhilaration, bringing me to tears and making me eagerly turn the final page.In summary, Onyx Storm is a masterclass in epic fantasy storytelling. It keeps readers on the edge of their seats while delivering the emotional depth and character growth fans have come to expect from Rebecca Yarros. If you’re a fan of dragons, magic, and unforgettable characters, this series is a must-read.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

- **内容**: 'Madness. This need between us is always the sweetest madness. He is the craving I'll never sate, the rush I'll never get enough of. Only him."Well if the above quote doesn't ruin real life men and romance for everybody! 😂 But it just goes to show that their love is endless, completely unbreakable, their devotion to each other is inspiring and unyielding, from the first moment they met at parapet they were inevitable and nothing and no one is ever going to tear them apart. Ultimately there is no Navarre, no Tyrrendor, no Basgaith without the two of them and they will do absolutely anything for each other, and Xaden already has, but what will it cost him? Them?Onyx Storm is more information heavy, with new threats arising in the place of old ones, old ones rising from the dead, new signets revealed, secret signets revealed out of desperation proves how intense this story still has yet to become. Friendships and loyalty are questioned and the line between right and wrong has begun to blur, as the fight for the Continent reaches new heights. How long can their friendships and bonds of loyalty take them before the line is irreparably crossed? And throughout it all is Violet's absolute dedication to saving the man, the friends, the family, the entire continent she loves deeply with all her heart, unable to bare the loss of anything more. But how can they defeat their opponent when their are traitors within working and feeding critical information to the enemy?The plot of the story is less intense in areas, truly the calm before the storm as I believe the plot of Onyx Storm is laying the foundations, building the story up in preparation before the author hits us with the penultimate box of the series which is for sure going to hurt. Introducing us to more of the incredible world inside this author's head, we get our first glimpse at the Isle Kingdoms, their unique cultures and lack of magic, learn more of the history of Navarre, and the introduction of new characters whilst expanding on the ones we have already met. My sincerest hope after reading Onyx Storm is that in the end, when the battles are all won and the continent is left in whatever shape it manages to survive in that it will be Aaric Grayscale left to rule because he is by far the best option of his family, especially after meeting Halden.'I don't care if she hands you a steaming pile of goat s*** .... No one complains. Got it? Smile and thank her.'I have never laughed so much in my entire life and this quote is evidence that its not only our favourite unfiltered play boy that can bring the comedic value to the story. Ridoc is wholly and unabashedly himself despite his sudden interest in being serious and wanting to now seem like the clown of the group, he reveals a new side to him and we get more insight into his an Aotrom's relationship which is just hilarious and so much more than I imagined.Overall, The Empyrean series is on its own level when it comes to ranking it against my over favourite books, and Onyx Storm is no different. It has everything that I look for in good book, humour, smut, information about new worlds and cultures, secrets, betrayal, the bonds of friendship and loyalty tested to their limits but above all connection because it makes me FEEL and a cliffhanger than has left my mind spinning with possibilities and questions. There is still so much that is unknown so much left to discover and to do that I am very worried about how the next book will end because as the penultimate book (unless she decides more books are needed) that one is going to be a doozy!

- **内容**: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.5This book was such a ride! (Pun intended, lol).I will admit, I did not do a reread of Fourth Wing or Iron Flame, and I regret that. If I had, maybe I wouldn't have been so lost in the beginning.If it's been a while in between each of the books, I'd recommend either a reread of the first two books or look up some key points and characters. Onyx Storm starts right where Iron Flame left off, spitting so much information and characters at you. It's hard to keep track.Once your brain finally  catches up and you start to (kind of) remember names of places, characters, and dragons, the choice to put this book down gets difficult!You really get to experience more of the world in this book. I love the world building and the history we learn throughout.I think my favorite thing was definitely the comedy! The dialog really displays the amazingly fun, hilarious sides to each character in this book. Love the sarcasm!This book had me screaming, crying, laughing out loud, all the emotions! LOVED it!I can't wait to read the next one in this series! Highly recommend!

- **内容**: Ahh, ugh, why?!!!I love Rebecca's writing to no end. Others complained about the start of this being slow and not at all intriguing. However, here I am all in my feels once again in this series. I wouldn't say the beginning is necessarily slow or not interesting, yet I do believe if you are invested into the storyline thus far you will not be disappointed.Rebecca provided in depth context from the first chapter of this book and did not stop. Everything she wrote had purpose and if one paid attention you can see all of it intertwining throughout the storyline. Author writes with a purpose and a passionate heart that it is conveyed in the story. I had great comprehension of the characters that had an essential role, but not a primary.Due to the nature and heart of the beast that is this story, the militant points and the romance stole my heart, broke it multiple times over, and has left me hanging. If there is not a next book, I would be extremely surprised....XADEN!!!!!

- **内容**: This book is a whirlwind of emotions. I’m still trying to figure out how on earth I’m supposed to carry on with my life while waiting for the next book. It has been one month since I read it and I am still NOT. OVER. IT. The way this book has me on chokehold is ridiculous.The world-building in this book is phenomenal - we get to explore new places beyond Basgiath and Tyrrendor! And there is always something happening. I had to pause at times just to breathe and collect my thoughts because my heart was racing throughout the entire book.Violet truly came into her own in this story. I’ve always known she was a badass, but wow, did our girl SHINE! She was smart, cunning, confident... I was so incredibly proud of her. And I was especially happy that we didn’t have any frustrating miscommunication issues with Xaden. Speaking of him, can he be any more perfect? Even after everything he goes through, this man still manages to make me swoon with his expressions of love for Violet. Their scenes together? Absolutely dreamy. I was kicking my feet with every interaction.And that ending… I don’t even know how to feel. I am very, very confused. That’s all I’ll say.Rebecca, you deserve all the time in the world to rest before writing the next book. But I will be dreaming of book four every. single. day.
