| 内容简介 | A transformative guide to rethinking our approach to goals, creativity and life itself from a neuroscientist and entrepreneur 'A compelling new take on a timeless concern' - CAL NEWPORT 'I loved this profound, practical and generous book' - OLIVER BURKEMAN 'Perfect for anyone seeking more freedom in how they design their life' - ALI ABDAAL 'One of the best productivity books that I've read' - RYDER CARROLL 'This book will change the way you design your goals and live your life' - NIR EYAL We're told productivity is all about single-minded focus, hard grind and big goals.

Ditching out-dated notions of chasing success, she demonstrates the joyful power of 'tiny experiments' in which goals are discovered, pursued and adapted on your own terms.

- **内容**: "I devoured 'Tiny Experiments' by Anne-Laure Le Cunff in a single morning, cover to cover, the day it arrived. That's how engaging and practical this book is. It's a breath of fresh air in the often overwhelming self-help genre.Le Cunff's approach, grounded in neuroscience and ancestral philosophy, offers a refreshing alternative to the traditional, linear goal-setting that many of us find stifling. Instead, she champions a circular growth model through 'tiny experiments,' turning uncertainty into an opportunity for self-discovery.What I particularly appreciated was the tangible advice and actionable steps. This isn't just theoretical; it's a hands-on guide to dismantling harmful beliefs, embracing imperfection, and truly living in alignment with your aspirations. The book is beautifully written and easily understood, making complex concepts accessible and immediately applicable.The quality of the content is exceptional. As someone who appreciates practical tools, I highlighted numerous passages and planned my tiny experiments before I even finished reading. This book is more than just a productivity guide; it's a transformative approach to life and even small projects.Tiny Experiments is a must-read if you're feeling stuck, overwhelmed by rigid goals, or simply looking for a more authentic way to navigate life. It's a game-changer, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.
