| 作者简介 | Jenny Draper has worked in museums and the heritage sector and now leads walking tours across London as a Blue Badge-certified private tour guide. She is passionate about teaching the public entertaining and fascinating titbits about history through her social media channels on YouTube and TikTok – where she has gathered over half a million followers – with a particular focus on the weird and wonderful. |
| 内容简介 | In her first book, popular TikTok historian J Draper uses her characteristic wit and intellect to introduce us to extraordinary figures marginalized by history, and the lessons we can learn from them.Witty and engaging TikTok historian J.D. Draper digs out unusual stories of individuals that have shaped the world, and discovers the lessons their unique experiences can teach us.Breaking away from history as told through the lens of kings, queens and nobles, this book instead lifts the lid on 24 fascinating stories of little-known underdogs, mavericks, trailblazers and oddballs. Through these stories you will meet characters such as:  The Chevalier d'Eon – a fencing master, spy and diplomat who came out as a woman in 18th-century LondonEllen and William Craft – a married couple who made a daring escape from slavery in the American south Peter the Wild Boy – a child found living in the woods in Germany who was taken to the royal court in EnglandCaroline Herschel – the first British woman to be paid for scientific work, and a discoverer of cometsWilliam Buckland – the man who wrote the first account of a dinosaur – yet who also ate the heart of a French kingEleanor Rykener – a gender-bending sex worker from medieval England who spilled juicy gossip about her clients in the clergy Juliana Popjoy - a society beauty who lived in a tree for yearsPaul Robeson – athlete, singer, actor, polyglot, activist... and handsome to bootThe Rebecca Rioters – a roving crowd of Welshmen who destroyed tollbooths dressed in skirts and bonnets.These poignant and often hilarious true stories show us that the world as we know it was built by a wider array of historical figures than we experienced in our schoolbooks. |

A rolling good time
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2025
- **内容**: I enjoyed Jenny's wit and superb story telling skills.  She brings these characters to life and makes reading about history thoroughly enjoyable.  If you know her from youtube, she stays true to her storytelling style; I can almost hear her speak.Anyway,  the book is a riot.

Excellent. Witty. Informative. Brilliant.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2025
- **内容**: Love this book. Draper's writing is clear, concise, witty, and punchy in all the right ways. The life stories are rich with historical facts and connections and I didn't want to put it down. My only gripe is at the lack of the Oxford comma and even that I will forgive because it is an absolute masterpiece. Going to need a history textbook in the same vein! I can't wait to share these Mavericks with my students!

tales from the odd side of history
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2025
- **内容**: Written with a very fun sense of humor, this book is the kind of history book that's not purely for history buffs. The author shines a light on lesser known figures of history, some known a little bit by academics & others pretty much drowning in obscurity. There's a good balance between showing the hard reality of life for disadvantaged people & balancing it out with a more positive outlook on the progress/advancements these misfits managed to make.I can't really pick a favorite chapter, not when I learned about such oddballs as:- an illiterate woman who experienced vivid visions, and somehow managed to get her words recorded in a book (that seemingly survived in a single copy)- a noblewoman who successfully defended her castle from invaders (with a sense of style)- or learning about the Rebecca Rioters (who really, really hated tollbooths and did something about it)

A national treasure
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2025
- **内容**: The author has had a wonderful career, both as a London tour guide and as a prolific creator of delightful social media videos about historical topics. Here she brings her energy, wit and charm to a book that covers 24 diverse characters in as many chapters. I enjoyed it as an audiobook, read by the author herself. Highly recommended.

Draper’s Delightful, Online Verve Doesn’t Translate Well in this Book
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2025
- **内容**: I’ve watched Draper’s YouTube channel for years and love it and her. She recounts quirky English historical stories with such enthusiasm and knowledge that they are engaging treats for viewers every time. I reserved my copy of “Mavericks” months ago and eagerly awaited its arrival—only to be disappointed. Based on its cover alone, I expected a dynamic layout of stories interspersed with tidbits like “did you know” trivia and artwork. Instead, it seems, Draper tried to adhere to her informal narrative style that works well for video but doesn’t translate well to a book format. “Mavericks” is both too informal with its use of informal language that rambles and too formal with its pages of blocked paragraphs and bland layout/design. I am really disappointed. I’ve read two stories that were somewhat interesting. Even the “teaches us…” tags don’t entice me to read the stories. I really expected something more dynamic—something with visual appeal and a succinct (or more formal) narrative that still captured Draper’s “voice”. I appreciate the inclusion of reference and index sections, although I think references would have been best included as footnotes or endnotes to each story. Still love her but will wait on purchasing any future books. Before you purchase it, peek inside first. Make sure it’s what you want.

Fun and really well written with enough detail to keep you entertained without being boring dates and too many facts.If you love history nuggets and stories to share get this. Bring on the TV series!
