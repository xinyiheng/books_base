| 作者简介 | H.W. Brands taught at Texas A&M University for sixteen years before joining the faculty at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is the Dickson Allen Anderson Centennial Professor of History. His books include Traitor to His Class, Andrew Jackson, The Age of Gold, The First American, and TR. Traitor to His Class and The First American were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize. |
| 内容简介 | From the two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist, bestselling historian, and author of Our First Civil War—a masterful biography of the Civil War general and two-term president who saved the Union twice, on the battlefield and in the White House. • “[A] splendidly written biography ... Brands does justice to one of America’s most underrated presidents.” —Dallas Morning News   Ulysses Grant emerges in this masterful biography as a genius in battle and a driven president to a divided country, who remained fearlessly on the side of right. He was a beloved commander in the field who made the sacrifices necessary to win the war, even in the face of criticism. He worked valiantly to protect the rights of freed men in the South. He allowed the American Indians to shape their own fate even as the realities of Manifest Destiny meant the end of their way of life. In this sweeping and majestic narrative, bestselling author H.W. Brands now reconsiders Grant's legacy and provides an intimate portrait of a heroic man who saved the Union on the battlefield and consolidated that victory as a resolute and principled political leader.Look for H.W. Brands's other biographies: THE FIRST AMERICAN (Benjamin Franklin), ANDREW JACKSON, TRAITOR TO HIS CLASS (Franklin Roosevelt) and REAGAN. |

I think this is Brand's best book, don't miss it!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2012
- **内容**: I have read four of H. W. Brands' previous books and although I have enjoyed each I have mostly ranked Mr. Brand's just below some of my favorite authors. I have found Brand's books are serviceable to his subject but I sometimes wish he had a better flair for storytelling and perhaps a novelist's eye for narrative. None up until this volume has been much of a page turner. It may be the meeting of subject here, General and President Grant, or my reaction to the subject... but I found Brand's latest book his best and a really enjoyable, readable, and a tremendously interesting narrative of Grant's life, the history of his time, and his impact on our Nations progress towards civil rights for all. (I am aware there are some other highly regarded recent biography's on Grant. I have not read these so cannot make a comparison. I can only but recommend this volume highly.)Brands keeps his chapter short and wraps each in an event in Grants life, or an event that will lead Grant's destiny towards it. Many of these are failures by others, from poor Union Generals to the disaster that was the Andrew Johnson Presidency. Brands expands the scope of his book without over burdening it by including concurrent history, a bit of analysis, many brief biographies of principles and Grant's difficult relationship with a father who apparently held Grant's promise with little regard.  Grant appears to have been, much like Truman a failure at anything to do with business or investing. But what he did have was character, leadership and the ability to inspire with empathy. A rather lost event to US History classes is how Grant as President took on the KKK and tore down its influence for decades to come. (It is a pity that for years after leaders failed to follow Grant's example.)As with any history or biography there are usually much relevance to our current history and culture. Our roots go deep into our past and revisionism seems to make people forget the sacrifice of so many to unsure the freedom for so many they would never meet and were yet unborn. Thank our inherent good luck as a nation to have had a Lincoln and a Grant when we needed them.

Perhaps this book should be titled, "The Quiet Man with the heart of a Lion".
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2014
- **内容**: This is an interesting, well-written and very well researched book about not only a man most of us know little about, but about portions of American history that for most of us is simply an empty hole.Brands' discussions about the Mexican War in the 1840's (including Grant's role, of course), were intriguing, especially in understanding the back-stabbing and political jockeying for power by the American presidents (hmmmmm... does that sound like today?) as they sought to justify their actions during the invasion of the "contested" portions of Texas and eventual invasion of Mexico. (My great-great grandfather was in the 25th regiment during that war, and I knew very little about it.)  There was just enough discussion about each subject with getting tedious, as many well-researched books can often get.And then the gold rush-- right at the heels upon the Mexican war, and it's purchase.... and Grant's duties while a young officer stationed in Oregon, farming on the side and selling his produce in California.The bad times-- Grant's duties with the 4th Infantry that involved heavy drinking, and his being pressured out of the service after 14 years, most likely due to the separation from his wife and children, whom he dearly loved.  His failures at each business venture.  His early friendship with William Sherman, also a former Army officer and also disappointed with civilian life after West Point and the Army.The turning point-- the beginnings of a Civil War, that both sides were convinced would end within a few short months, but which went on for four years.  Grant, tenuously appointed a colonel of Illinois militia, who took a "problem" unit and turned it into an efficient fighting machine in a very short time, appointed to a brigade.  Grant, who turned his brigade and his talent for war into results.  Grant, who took forts Henry and Donaldson, opening up the Ohio River again.  Grant, who took Nashville-- and Memphis-- and Vicksburg, after a long and difficult struggle.  His taking of Vicksburg cut the Confederacy in half and re-opened the Mississippi River to the Union.His next campaign-- Chattanooga-- was again nothing short of brilliant.  This calm, measured and soft-spoken 41-year-old man from Illinois simply out-generaled his southern opponents.  He shortly turned Chattanooga from potentially a disaster into a southern rout, taking both Missionary Ridge as well as Lookout Mountain.  How he did it, and how he led men, is nicely discussed by the author.  (Reviewer's note-- shortly after this battle, my great-great grandfather was killed around Dalton Georgia; he was a 35-year-old Confederate private in the Alabama Infantry.  It was nice to be able to learn more about the engagements he was directly involved with-- he was at Missionary Ridge that day.)Grant, now promoted again to fix the problems in the east, is ordered to Washington, where he takes command of the Union Army.  And I guess we all know the rest of that story.  For the first time, the brilliant Robert E. Lee is up against a smart, dedicated and tenacious opponent, and after a long series of battles-- and thousands of additional casualties-- peace is declared.Grant, now the man who "saved the Union", is a national hero.  As well he should be.After peace, reconstruction... And Andrew Johnson.  And finally, election to the presidency.Serving two terms as President of the United States, the book does a great job examining his presidency.  But for the sake of the length of this review (and for those of you reading it, thanks for your patience), I'll simply close by stating that the author's examination of his presidency is as well done as the other portions of his life.This is an excellent book.  Add it to your library.

- **内容**: The Man Who Saved the Union by H.W. Brands is an excellent biography of Ulysses Grant, a former soldier plucked from obscurity by the Civil War to become first, Commander of the Union forces and then President.It is well-written, detailed and informative and offers an interesting re-examination of the much maligned Grant presidency.Overall, a very good book.

- **标题**: Brands Delivers A First-Rate Biography
- **日期**: Reviewed in Canada on September 9, 2013
- **内容**: The book starts off, with Grant stumbling through his early life. In fact, the first hundred or so pages are somewhat depressing. After a short stint in the military, Grant moves onto the private sector. He has zero business sense and even worse money management skills. Grant seems to have a knack, for failing at everything he undertakes.  Then the US Civil War starts. The Union Army is short of officers, and Grant suddenly finds his military experience is in demand. The war gives Grant, the opportunity to utilize his one set of skills. He is a brilliant military tactician. Grant lays out meticulous battle plans. He understands and plans every logistical detail of a battle. Grant was also familiar with many of the Confederate generals. This allowed him to plan around, an anticipated move by a Confederate general. But most of all, Grant has the ability to stay level headed while under fire. Even within the most crushing of battle field conditions, Grant maintains a calm, cool, and collected character. This allows Grant, to make critical decisions during the heat of battle. Readers with an interest in military history, will enjoy Grant`s battle field maneuvers.  Later Ulysses Grant becomes President of the United States. His military skill set, does not easily convert to the political arena. His administration is plagued with corruption problems. Brands tends to skim over some of the corruption details. I also found Brands was rather polite, in regards to Grant`s fondness for whiskey. The political part of the book, was not as interesting as the military chapters.  But over all, this was a exceptional biography. Brands has researched the material and produced a rather intriguing read.

- **标题**: Two books in one
- **日期**: Reviewed in Canada on October 2, 2013
- **内容**: The first half of the book is about Grant the solder and is a lively and informative read.  The second half of the book is Grant the President and due to the subject matter does not flow a smoothly as the first half of the book.  Although uneven it was still a worthwhile and enjoyable read.
