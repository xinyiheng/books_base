| 内容简介 | The Instant New York Times Bestseller • One of People Magazine's Top 10 Books of the Year"The rare celebrity memoir that's also a literary read. As funny as it is reflecive, it shares stories behind Pacino's hardscrabble upbringing, classic films and journey to icon status." —People MagazineFrom one of the most iconic actors in the history of film, an astonishingly revelatory account of a creative life in fullTo the wider world, Al Pacino exploded onto the scene like a supernova. He landed his first leading role, in The Panic in Needle Park, in 1971, and by 1975, he had starred in four movies—The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, Serpico, and Dog Day Afternoon—that were not just successes but landmarks in the history of film. Those performances became legendary and changed his life forever. Not since Marlon Brando and James Dean in the late 1950s had an actor landed in the culture with such force.But Pacino was in his midthirties by then, and had already lived several lives. A fixture of avant-garde theater in New York, he had led a bohemian existence, working odd jobs to support his craft. He was raised by a fiercely loving but mentally unwell mother and her parents after his father left them when he was young, but in a real sense he was raised by the streets of the South Bronx, and by the troop of buccaneering young friends he ran with, whose spirits never left him. After a teacher recognized his acting promise and pushed him toward New York’s fabled High School of Performing Arts, the die was cast. In good times and bad, in poverty and in wealth and in poverty again, through pain and joy, acting was his lifeline, its community his tribe. Sonny Boy is the memoir of a man who has nothing left to fear and nothing left to hide. All the great roles, the essential collaborations, and the important relationships are given their full due, as is the vexed marriage between creativity and commerce at the highest levels. The book’s golden thread, however, is the spirit of love and purpose. Love can fail you, and you can be defeated in your ambitions—the same lights that shine bright can also dim. But Al Pacino was lucky enough to fall deeply in love with a craft before he had the foggiest idea of any of its earthly rewards, and he never fell out of love. That has made all the difference. |

Al Pacino’s Journey Through Art and Identity
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2024
- **内容**: In Sonny Boy, Al Pacino offers an intimate, compelling memoir that transcends the familiar tropes of celebrity life stories. This isn’t just a recounting of roles and accolades; it’s a candid exploration of identity, artistry, and self-discovery, written with the same vulnerability and intensity that have defined Pacino’s acting career.From the very beginning, Pacino immerses readers in his journey—his early days in the Bronx, the drive that pushed him toward acting, and the search for belonging both on and off stage. He delves into his process, his inspirations, and the people who shaped his life and career, including mentors, co-stars, and family. The title Sonny Boy itself is more than just a name; it’s a nod to his roots, a tribute to his past, and a symbol of the complexities that come with staying true to oneself in an ever-shifting world.Pacino’s openness about his struggles, both personal and professional, makes Sonny Boy an inspiring read. He shares stories of failure, heartbreak, and self-doubt, yet each chapter is infused with hope, grit, and a palpable love for the craft of acting. For aspiring artists and longtime fans alike, his memoir is a powerful reminder of the resilience needed to pursue one’s dreams, and the courage it takes to face the world while discovering one’s true self.What truly sets Sonny Boy apart is Pacino’s ability to inspire readers. Through his reflections, he encourages us to dig deeper, embrace our imperfections, and remain curious. His journey reminds us that true greatness is not just about talent or success but about dedication, humility, and a profound respect for life’s complexities.In Sonny Boy, Al Pacino has given us more than a memoir—he has given us a guide to living with passion, purpose, and authenticity. This book will leave a lasting impact, much like the characters he brought to life on screen, reminding us to seek truth, pursue our art, and never stop searching for meaning.

No gossip; Candid and kind for the most part until some final ramblings
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024
- **内容**: "I didn't want to act; I HAD to act." And he never doubted that he would - even his school classmates voted him Most Likely to Succeed. He had a wild imagination, rich inner life, & innate energy & spark that couldn't be contained. His story is that of the tipping point in movies from the studio system to the Golden Era of the 1970s. He took every menial job to support himself while he studied acting, hung out in the Village of the 1960s, & read voraciously. He references his South Bronx boyhood throughout the book as his friends & family there shaped him. He credits his mother for instilling a love of movies/theatre & keeping on the path away from drugs that killed all his boyhood friends.He grew up being mistaken for a non-English speaking immigrant & experienced bigotry for his ethnic looks but he didn't let that stop him pursuing his dream. He was lucky - The Godfather was his 2nd movie role! He reflects that he, DeNiro, & Hoffman were 3 NYC actors who changed the face of movies. The writing (assuming there's a ghostwriter here) is factual and breezy. He speaks positively about everyone he encounters. He's quite candid that he never wanted to be married & mentions who he dated but nothing more than X & I were living on the Upper East Side or Y introduced me to a director. His references to family all seem to be about his divorced parents and grandparents even though he had 4 children late in life. The way his career unfolded seemed to be serendipitous (his family was from a town in Sicily called Corleone - the role was meant to be).The book takes a downturn about 2/3 when he moves to LA. He's 60, uncomfortable there, lives far beyond his means, & admits he doesn't like to think about money so he goes broke & has to return to making money through film, tv, seminars, & anything to pay the bills. He claims the idea of leaving money to anyone never crossed his mind; he missed his grandfather but never expected his death would mean a windfall. The final chapters of the book reflect upon aging - 70 makes him vulnerable & 80 he doesn't really want to talk about so he returns to the memories of his childhood bonds.Pacino seems candid, including his quirks & mistakes, but gives us a 60 year history of movie-making. Great for movie lovers.

An amazing memoir from an amazing actor
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024
- **内容**: This is one of my favorite memoirs I've read, no hyperbole. I've loved Al Pacino as an actor since I was about 10 and watched "The Godfather" for the first time, and I've been obsessed with his abilities ever since, but he's been such a private person that I never had a sense that I "knew" him. (Yes, I understand that we never really know our artistic favorites, but Al has been so quiet over the decades, much more than typical stars.) After listening to him read "Sonny Boy" (I chose the unabridged audiobook), I feel like I've had the incredible honor of really getting a glimpse into his heart, his memories, and his mind, as well as his acting genius. Listening to this 84 year old man, with his gravely voice and South Bronx accent, tell the stories of his hardscrabble youth with cinematic clarity, working his way through his life of acting, self-discovery, and self-effacement - this was simply magical. This memoir is full of frank confessions and incredible tributes to his favorite people; Al Pacino bears his soul throughout the book, and in every scenario, you feel his passion for theatre, acting, literature, and cinema as much as his passion for his family, friends, and fellow artists. The final five minutes - and then the final line - brought the tears streaming down my face, and now I've bought the hardback to make sure this memoir from my favorite American actor ever is permanently in my library. What a maestro!

- **日期**: Reviewed in Japan on January 9, 2025
- **内容**: The book was packed simply but very effectively with a hard cardboard support and was obviously handled with care in shipping (unlike Amazon delivery in other countries I could mention (cough UK cough)).The book itself is in excellent condition, no kinks, dogears, scuffs, scratches, etc.It is also a Large Print version which I don’t think is mentioned in the listing but is very desirable for this kind of large paperback format. I saw a similarly thick paperback edition at Heathrow airport which had the standard small font; also cool, but I think large print is much better in this size.Very happy. Thanks.
