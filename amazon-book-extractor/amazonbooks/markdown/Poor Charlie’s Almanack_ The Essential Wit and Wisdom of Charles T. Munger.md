| 内容简介 | From the legendary vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, lessons in investment strategy, philanthropy, and living a rational and ethical life.  “A timeless classic that will change how you approach life. There is a billion-dollar education inside this book.” —Shane Parrish, founder of Syrus Partners and Farnam Street   “Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up,” Charles T. Munger advises in Poor Charlie’s Almanack. Originally published in 2005, this compendium of eleven talks delivered by the legendary Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman between 1986 and 2007 has become a touchstone for a generation of investors and entrepreneurs seeking to absorb the enduring wit and wisdom of one of the great minds of the 20th and 21st centuries.   Edited by Peter D. Kaufman, chairman and CEO of Glenair and longtime friend of Charlie Munger—whom he calls “this generation’s answer to Benjamin Franklin”—this abridged Stripe Press edition of Poor Charlie’s Almanack features a brand-new foreword by Stripe cofounder John Collison.    Poor Charlie’s Almanack draws on Munger’s encyclopedic knowledge of business, finance, history, philosophy, physics, and ethics—and more besides—to introduce the latticework of mental models that underpin his rational and rigorous approach to life, learning, and decision-making. Delivered with Munger’s characteristic sharp wit and rhetorical flair, it is an essential volume for any reader seeking to go to bed a little wiser than when they woke up. |

- **内容**: The book gives you access to the wisdom of a very successful man, Charlie Munger. He attempts to bridge academic education with practical knowledge in this thought-provoking read. I am not the same person that I was, prior to reading it. Definitely worth it!

A little redundant, but worth reading
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2025
- **内容**: Although there are worthwhile take aways from this book, I feel that each talk is a somewhat redundant attack on academia written out in often rambling fashion.  I haven’t decided yet if it’s a difficult read or just uninteresting.  I’d hate to be critical of someone I admire as much as I do Charlie Munger, but I’m not sure turning these specific speeches was the best showcase of his wisdoms.  Still, 4 stars because there are some meaningful take aways for people that are interested in teaching themselves about the world.

An Interesting Story, With Lots Of Wisdom Included
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2024
- **内容**: Exposure to the casual wit and extensive wisdom of Charlie Munger primed me to grab the book and try to absorb a bit more.  The wit doesn't translate as well to paper as a long life's worth of wisdom does.The book is structured with an opening section that shares a lot of the life background that prepared Charlie Munger for his future.  Starting in post-depression Nebraska working in the Buffet store, then on to law school and much more, the story builds through the early association with Warren Buffet, and the broad learning paths through independent learning and a voracious appetite for knowledge.  That appetite for knowledge is an enduring theme throughout the book and his life.  Hw worked hard to impart that same love of broad learning and wisdom to family, friends, business associates and students along the way.  The lessons and the delivery are both top tier.The rest of the book is a series of descriptions of lectures Charlie gave later in life primarily at various learning institutions.  Primarily law and business schools it seems, but a couple others thrown in too.  The common theme is to always be open to learnings from outside your focus discipline, and integrate all those outside learnings to build a broad base to continuously build on.I'm 20+ years Charlie's junior, and can see where the guidance he shares would have made my early career  a bit smoother.  That said, I think it would be great for people to read and learn from Charlie starting early, then re-read at life intervals that allow one's own life experiences and situations to benefit from regular course-corrections based on the ideas shared in the book.  I know too many youngsters who have attention focus based on continuous screen movement and action;  few may initially appreciate the pleasure of reading a good book like this.  But a read in mid-teens, and again as major decision points arise, would help most people tremendously.Some of us have had the great fortune to have mentors along the way.  Even if you already have that, adding another lesson or twelve from Charlie can only benefit.Yes, I highly recommend this book.  It should almost be essential reading from those stepping up to and stepping through their lives and careers.  It's that good.
