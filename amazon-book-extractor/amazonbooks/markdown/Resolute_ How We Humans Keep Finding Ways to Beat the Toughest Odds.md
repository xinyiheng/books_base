| 内容简介 | The author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Saved tells the remarkable story of his harrowing recovery after surviving a deadly Russian missile attack in Ukraine, and shares the most profound lessons he learned about the power of resilience. After suffering horrific, nearly-fatal injuries while covering the war in Ukraine in 2022, Benjamin Hall was told he’d need to spend two years in a hospital learning how to walk again. Instead, he made it home to his family in just six months. Sustained by his positive attitude and relentless will to keep moving forward, Hall impressed and inspired all those who followed his story and progress, with many wondering how they could bottle his seemingly superhuman resolve.Now with a greater degree of perspective, Hall analyzes the psychological aftermath of the Russian missile attack that profoundly altered his life. A clear-eye work of journalism and personal meditation elevated by remarkable storytelling, Resolute is Hall’s probing inquiry into why he is alive and thriving today. As he confronts his own mortality, Hall analyzes the key factors that allowed him to survive the missile attack, endure multiple surgeries, adapt to new prosthetics, and cope with the psychological burdens of severe trauma. Each chapter features powerful stories from Hall’s arduous recovery, interwoven with expert advice and insights from the extraordinary people he encountered along the way—doctors who heal broken bodies and damaged souls; therapists who push despairing patients to discover the depths of perseverance; scientists who have studied how the body and mind are sustained under unfathomable duress; and families who exhibit exceptional strength in the face of sudden tragedy. Resolute is more than a survival story—it is a testament to the saving power of the human spirit. From embracing post-traumatic optimism to discovering untapped stores of tenacity, this book is a roadmap for those looking to discover and fortify their own powers of resilience and persevere against the odds. As Hall shares the vivid and inspiring account of his own survival, he implores us to consider that these reservoirs of strength and resolve are inherent to our humanity—and reside within each of us, too. |
