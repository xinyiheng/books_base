- **内容**: Archer, Iris and Olive, a gorgeous family in the making...Laurie Gilmore has once again blown me away with another cute story from Dream Harbor (yes, I'm using the US spelling)! I love the small town vibe, where everyone knows everyone, and that includes everyone's business. The elderly contingent of Dream Harbor are awesome, such gossips, but equally their hearts are in the right place, and they just want to help.Olive is a cute, sassy little girl who knows what she wants, and goes all out to get it, and that includes getting her Dad and Iris together. She was so funny and made me laugh a lot. Regina Reagan, as the narrator did a great job with all the characters, but particularly Olive, she had her spot on.I listened to this book in less than 24 hours, whilst I was outside, getting my garden ready for spring. If you're up for an adorable, slightly spicy, small-town romance, then grab a copy of this and settle down with a cuppa and a packet of biscuits and relocate to Dream Harbor for a few hours.

- **内容**: I love this series, it’s an easy read that is a one sit read.  It’s a cozy romance that focuses on Archer this time, he has just found out he has a child so has to come back to look after her. He gets a nanny Iris as he’s busy working at the Pancake house as a chef.  It’s a feel good book that will leave a smile on your face.  Loved it.  5 star read.  Thanks to Netgalley and the publishers for a copy.

- **内容**: I loved reading this book.Archer has only recently found out that he has a five year old daughter called Olive, her mother passed away. Suddenly the life he was living as a chef in France now seems a long time ago.Iris, loves her life, and has never thought about being in long relationship, or even having kids. But, she has taken the job of being a nanny to Olive as she has financial problems. She is a yoga water aerobics instructor and most of her attendees are elderly. It was lovely to see her interactions with them.Her relationship with Olive was lovely too.The food made your mouth water and the different ways in which pancakes were made, made me want to try the  recipes.I recommend this book.
