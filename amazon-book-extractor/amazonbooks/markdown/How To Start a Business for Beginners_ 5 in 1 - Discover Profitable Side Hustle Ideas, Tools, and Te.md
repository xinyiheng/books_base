One of These Might Be a Good Fit For You
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2025
- **内容**: This purchase turned out to be an unusual smorgasbord of business and marketing knowledge - from setting up a food truck business to the fine arts of Sixth Sigma methodology. Perhaps the strongest two books in the series of five. The passive income sections felt they needed more a more concrete plan, and pitfalls - since the 'passive' income dream usually is anything but for most that attempt it.

- **标题**: Your Business Roadmap

- **内容**: From theoretical to very practical, and from varied business strategies, this is a very entrepreneurial rich book. This book exceeds the conceptual frame of enterprise launches and sustenance with highly useable advice from how to leverage your Instagram marketing to passive income ideas, and more. The originality of this section regarding food trucks can hardly be debated, while there is a toolkit with too much scope in certain parts. Yet, the diversity means something for everyone, whether you're a business newbie or just looking for fresh perspectives. What really impressed me was how it made such subjects as credit repair and Lean Six Sigma approachable. If you're ready to build a business and reshape your future, this guide is a strong starting point.
