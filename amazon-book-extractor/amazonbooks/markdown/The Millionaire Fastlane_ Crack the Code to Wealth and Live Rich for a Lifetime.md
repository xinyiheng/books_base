| 作者简介 | MJ DeMarco is an entrepreneur and international best-selling author whose books have been translated into over 25 languages worldwide. He is currently the co-founder of https://GoalSumo.com, a unique goal-setting and productivity system based on his proprietary 1/5/10 Strategy.
He is also the founder of Viperion Publishing Corp., a media company that manages, distributes, and licenses his published work. He also is the founding member and creator of The Fastlane Forum, an entrepreneurial discussion forum featuring nearly 1,000,000 posts and 80,000 members, one of the web's top destinations for Fastlane entrepreneurial business discussions.
Before embarking into the world of authorship, MJ DeMarco was the former start-up Founder/CEO of Limos.com and LimoForSale.com (1997-2007), two global ground transportation aggregators and marketplaces that he successfully built and grew into profitable multi-million dollar enterprises, all with no money, no formal training, and with just a few employees. In 2001, he sold the company in an exit event but later reacquired the company via bankruptcy reorganization. He later sold the company again in 2007 to a Phoenix-based private equity company.
By refusing to accept society's default template for mediocrity (THE SCRIPT: jobs, 401(k)s, frugality, give your life savings to Wall Street) MJ was able to semi-retire young in his 30s without sacrificing the good life. Yes, that means he isn't driving a 20 year old truck, he isn't living in a trailer down by the river, and he isn't buried in Excel spreadsheets while he broods over the Starbucks he couldn't drink because saving $4.12 was more critical. (Do people seriously believe this?)
Currently, MJ lives in the beautiful foothills of Alpine, Utah, at the base of the Wasatch Mountains, where he endeavors to live a life of compassion, health, and happiness while empowering people to live their best life.

| 内容简介 | **** UPDATED AND REFRESHED FOR BITCOIN / CRYPTO ERA**** INTERNATIONAL BEST-SELLER: TRANSLATED AND PUBLISHED WORLDWIDE IN OVER 15 LANGUAGESHas the "settle-for-less" financial plan become your plan for wealth? That sounds something like this:Graduate from college, get a good job, save 10% of your paycheck, buy a used car, cancel the movie channels, quit drinking expensive Starbucks mocha lattes, save and penny-pinch your life away, trust your life-savings to Wall Street, and one day, when you are oh, say, 65 years old, you can retire rich.Since you were old enough to hold a job, you've been hoodwinked to believe that wealth can be created by blindly trusting in the uncontrollable and unpredictable markets: the housing market, the stock market, and the job market. This soul-sucking, dream-stealing dogma is "The Slowlane" - an impotent FINANCIAL GAMBLE that dubiously promises wealth in a wheelchair.Accept the Slowlane as your financial roadmap and your financial future will blow carelessly asunder on a sailboat of HOPE: HOPE you can get a job and keep it, HOPE the stock market doesn't tank, HOPE for a robust economy, HOPE, HOPE, and HOPE. Is HOPE really the centerpiece of your family's financial plan?Drive the Slowlane and you will find your life deteriorate into a miserable exhibition about what you cannot do, versus what you can. For those who don't want a lifetime subscription to mediocrity, there is an alternative; an expressway to extraordinary wealth capable of burning a trail to financial freedom faster than any road out there. And shockingly, this road has nothing to do with jobs, 401(k), mutual funds, or a lifestyle of miserly living and 190 square foot tiny houses. Just some of what you will learn:Why jobs, 401(k)s, mutual funds, and 40-years of mindless frugality will never make you rich young.Why most entrepreneurs fail and how to immediately put the odds in your favor.The real law of wealth: Leverage this and wealth has no choice but to be magnetized to you.The leading cause of poorness: Change this and you change everything.How the rich really get rich - and no, it has nothing to do with a paycheck or a 401K match.The mathematics of wealth and how any "Joe Schmo" can tap into real wealth real fast.Why the guru's sacred deities - compound interest and indexed funds - are impotent wealth accelerators.Why popular guru platitudes like "do what you love" and "follow your passion" will most likely keep you poor, not rich.And 250+ more poverty busting distinctions...Demand more. Change lanes and find your explosive wealth accelerator. Hit the Fastlane, crack the code to wealth, and find out how to live rich for a lifetime. |

- **标题**: On my 3rd reading--and still loving this book!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2012
- **内容**: Well, I am on my 3rd reading of this book--and that surprises even me!  WHY?--because  there are so many fascinating and USEFUL distinctions which make the book a veritable goldmine of actionable PRINCIPLES for creating wealth.This book will expand your mental horizons about creating wealth and tremendously broaden your wealth perspective.  As the author himself states early on--this is not a "HOW to get rich" book with "paint by the numbers"  or "lead-me-by-the-hand-and show-me-exactly-what-to-do"  book.Instead, it is about an overall Mindset for creating wealth and freedom while one still has the vitality and enthusiasm to ENJOY it, rather than the "Wealth in a Wheelchair" plan endorsed by most financial "authorities" and society at large---work 40-50 years, save 10% of your income, invest in the stock market, and by golly HOPE you will be a millionaire by the time you're 65 or 70.It is written in a "brash young man"  style, wherein the author references his Lamborghinis, his palatial home, his money and his freedom on several occasions. This has offended many 1-Star reviewers. [Note: I find that one of the best places to discover a "loser's" mentality is some of the  1-Star reviews concerning wealth-creation books.  So many of them want detailed how-to's  instead of the wealth Mindset without which all the how-to's in the world won't work anyway. And they seem to resent rich authors. In my experience it is extremely difficult to create wealth for those who resent the wealthy. OK, OK--I'll get off my mini-soapbox now...]My own view would be--why not CELEBRATE the author's efforts, subsequent wealth, and his willingness to share his hard-won wisdom about creating affluence?A few tidbits from the book which are simple enough, but extremely valuable in application:1) Process vs. EventSociety seems to laud the Event--the sports figure who gets a multi-million dollar contract;  The entrepreneur who hits a home run and makes billions;  The movie star who gets $15 million for a picture, etc.  What society seldom focuses on is the multi-year Process of practice, failure, perseverance, experimentation, which eventually results in the Event. Wealth is created by consistently applied Process, which culminates in the Event.2)  The Three Paths:The Sidewalk:  Living paycheck to paycheck with instant gratification as the main goal. Probably characterizes 50% of our society right now.The Slowlane:  the "40-50" year plan of working hard, saving, and living frugally hoping for pie-in-the-sky in the future (when you are old). The author gives some neat, mathematical formlas to demonstrate why the Slowlane plan can NOT succeed--except for a few rare exceptions.The Fastlane:  Using precise formulas and leverage (see below) to create wealth and freedom while young.3) ULL vs  CUL  The distinction  between Uncontrollable Limited Leverage--trying to control the financial limitations of a job by working harder/longer or getting more education/training to raise your salary, and trying to use the uncontrollable stock market as your ticket to future  wealth.Compared with Controllable Unlimited Leverage from having your own business which you can control and which creates assets you can leverage. CUL requires that you use the NECST formula...4)  NECST formula: I wish I had known this one 30 plus years ago! I have been  successful in several businesses,  but by using NECST  (Need, barriers to Entry, Control, Scalability, Time)  my businesses would have generated so much more income and leverage potential. You can bet I am applying NECST now!Never start a business without first evaluating it according to the criteria of NECST.  At some point, the Fastlane is culminated when your rapid-growth business can be converted into Equity.There are numerous "mathematical Formulas or Factors for wealth"  which are  simple but EXCELLENT.  Their simplicity makes them easy to remember and actionable.Once you have gotten the Slowlane vs. Fastlane distinction, so much becomes crystal clear about businesses and their true potential for wealth creation. An example is the author's irreverent, amusing, and spot-on critique of Fastlane financial gurus and authors selling Slowlane books and products to their adoring fans. My summary of the critique:  Fastlane author/guru --"I make my fortune and become rich NOW by selling you millions of books and pedaling advice about how you can work 40-50 years on the Slowlane and HOPE to retire rich `someday.' And by the way--cut out those $6 Lattes!"The author's explanation of converting your Fastlane business and cashflow into Equity is an excellent summary. This info is available from many other sources, but here it is clarified and simplified into APPLICABLE principles.I could go on, but I would simply recommend you read this book. I really do think you will enjoy it and profit from the information.

- **标题**: Finally A Business Book That Cuts Through The BS and Actually Delivers Superior Value For A Complete Steal!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2011
- **内容**: MJ's book is probably one of the best business books I have read in my entire life, and to be frank I rarely ever say that about most books I read.After reading MJ's book, I have probably already recommended it to 30+ of my closest entrepreneurial friends who also have felt the same about the book.As an avid reader of many business books, it is hard to come by a book that truly cuts through all of the BS, and delivers time-tested and proven information from a been there done that no-nonsense entrepreneur who truly cares about your success.Compared to other authors who write books that just want to up-sell you into multi-thousand dollar training programs on the backend, this book stands in the face of all of that noise and "flips them the bird."Not only does this book give you the mindset you must adopt if you want to be a successful entrepreneur, but even more so gives you the tools to use and implement to achieve massive success.I recommend that when implementing a new business idea, or enhancing your current business, please, please, please use this book as your guide.You won't be sorry! By using this book to help you, you are definitely guaranteed to reach all of the goals you have set for yourself and your business...and I stand behind that statement 100% because it has already helped me tremendously with my mindset and business.Here is the truth...While most business books I read are "good," very few of them are great.MJ's book falls into my "great" category for many reasons as described below!In his book, not only do you get a glimpse into the mind of a been there done that multi-millionaire entrepreneur, who made his money OUTSIDE of the publishing business (unlike some of the most well-known business/financial guru's), but even more so, you get a to buy a book that you will want to keep on your night stand forever and be something you reference for many years to come.The parts in the book that truly stuck out to me, and helped me gain a lot of insights and clarity for my business, life and financial plan were the specific parts highlighted below.1. Why Understanding The Process To Creating A Successful Business, is More Important Than Focusing on the One Time "Wealth Event" at The End...(The truth is that if you complete and stick to the process correctly, the wealth event at the end will be a result of all your hard work and discipline to not get ahead of yourself). (After reading this section I realized too many individuals are focusing on the wrong thing when they go into business. This mindset is definitely going to flip you for a loop and challenge every previous thought you ever had about accomplishing anything, and building a company for that matter)2. The Essential Elements To A Fastlane Business (And no they are not what you would expect...this part of the book is worth MILLIONS of dollars to you, and will help you eliminate TIME-WASTING wheel spinning activities in during your current and future entrepreneurial career)3. How to Make a Decision When Faced With Two Semi-Desirable Options (The logic in this is so sound, and the process can be duplicated over and over again, no matter what you are choosing between in the future)4. How To Truly Value Your Business and Set it Up To Be Sold For Millions (And no...it has nothing to do with how many "users" you have without any profit...get ready for this part of the book to blow you away)5. How To Create An Effective Exit Strategy For Your Business That Will Leave You Wealthy...Never Have To Worry About Money or What You Do With Your Time Ever Again (This mindset is so critical to grasp, as most of these web 2.0 companies exit strategy is "sell to Google," when in reality that exit strategy is like praying to win the lottery without a sound base to stand on)6. How To Effectively Think About Investing The Money You Make After Selling Your Company For Millions to Ensure You Continually Grow Your Wealth and Income (If you thought you should be counting on the stock market to make you wealthy, this part of the book is going to shock you, but makes so much sense)So without making the book sound any better than I already have, just listen to me and buy the book...you won't be sorry...just trust me.Truth be told...The book was so good that I even bought it a second time on my new E-Reading device (nook), because I wanted to make sure I had it with me forever to reference if I ever lost my physical copy, or if one of my entrepreneurial friends secretly stole it from me without letting me know they were going to borrow it.And finally...If I had to give a rating out of 5 stars for this book, I would give it a 10. You can't go wrong buying this book because the author truly cares about helping you create all of the entrepreneurial success your heart desires...Hell, he even gives you his e-mail address to contact him after finishing the book! I don't know about you but that says a lot.Enjoy the book! You won't be sorry!-ScottP.S. I even interviewed him for my site here is the link to the interview enjoy![...]

- **内容**: MJ Demarco is unabashed and unashamed, and has built a smallempire helping us in that manner. Demarco’s multifacetedapproach to building a brand around what you are trying to teachand inspire is excellent. Demarco has something to say, and hedoes what he says, and it works, and he wants to help you see this,too. It is inspiring. At a time, you could interact with the authorthrough his online forums — an extremely effective way of bothcommunicating a message and promoting a book.The read is fast that way. The Fastlane is the fast lane you get inwhen you start reading because he is a good writer. You can feelyourself in his shoes. The book moves forward at a good pace ifyou let it. And you learn along the way. At a minimum, you getinspired and gain some of MJ’s energy, which is what you need ifyou really are going to push it in business.Unscripted is a lock once you read through just Part 1 and Part 2.By that time, you relate strongly to the dissatisfaction MJdescribes when you have to work for someone else besidesyourself. For anyone who has any entrepreneurial spirit at all,taking on your own business — your own endeavor — will becomeparamount once you read this book.
