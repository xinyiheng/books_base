- **内容**: Wonderful book, full of pictures and entities in which allows one to better understand business. BUSINESS 101 would be a higher educational value, as many classes go over many ways of which to get a business started, it's not easy however, many problems occur when one is starting a business of ones own, taking much time of which can be eliminated by entering the world of business through a University and or planned endeavor. I.E. Accounting, Psychology, Energy levels of employee's, as well as supplies and various situations of which one will run into. Where do I get the keys to the building of which my business will conduct itself, most people speak of grants, while others speak of loans, leaving one in a hole so to speak. It's not easy but can be done with the help and aid of the community.

Illustrations are nice and helpful
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2014
- **内容**: I've only gotten through about 1/4 of the book, and I've already learned a lot about business and many of its important topics. I'm a relative novice when it comes to business, so this may be a walk through the park for some pro's or advanced readers. Illustrations are nice and helpful, and the style is clean. There are more than a couple typos throughout the book, but I'm not that critical of books anyways. The only thing I question about this book is its structure. As a novice, I wonder why some topics are brought up before others, and vise-versa. I can't say this is a detriment to the book, just a personal curiosity.

Great book for learning concepts
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2019
- **内容**: The book does two things great. It takes the sound bite of a philosophy and leads the chapter with it. This help you to know whether to spend time on it or not and it shows graphs of the concepts being described. It's a great learning tool.
