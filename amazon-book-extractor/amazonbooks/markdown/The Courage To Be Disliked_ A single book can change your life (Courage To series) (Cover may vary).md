- **标题**: Great book for learning some essential life skills

- **内容**: The Courage to Be Disliked is a transformative read that challenges conventional ideas about happiness, relationships, and self-worth. Written as a dialogue between a philosopher and a young seeker, the book uses Adlerian psychology to unpack why we feel stuck in life and how we can break free.What makes this book unique is its conversational style, which makes profound psychological concepts accessible without being overly academic. It reframes many of our struggles, like seeking approval or living in fear of rejection, as choices we make rather than inevitable realities. This perspective is both liberating and empowering.One of the key takeaways for me was the idea that happiness isn't something we pursue but a byproduct of living authentically and contributing to others. The book also emphasizes the importance of accepting responsibility for our emotions and actions without blaming our past or external circumstances.However, it’s worth noting that some readers may find the advice a bit idealistic or challenging to implement. It’s not a step-by-step guide but rather a philosophical shift in how we view ourselves and the world.Overall, The Courage to Be Disliked is a must-read for anyone seeking deeper clarity and freedom in their life. It’s thought-provoking, inspiring, and will leave you questioning—and ultimately redefining—what it means to lead a fulfilling life.

- **内容**: So much of the advice given to 'people pleasers' does not help. Just like yourself. Don't worry what THEY say. Only your opinion matters. If these things were already the case the advice would perhaps not be needed.The courage To Be Disliked is a conversation between a philosopher and a cynical youth who struggles with self-acceptance and  dislike of the world. The conversation is slow and a bit boring to start with but soon accelerates into a no-holds barred discussion of what it means to be a member of society and what freedom in that society really is. It's apparently based on the work of Alfred Adler a contemporary of Freud's but is is NOTHING like Freud's work. If you are looking for a truly different set of ways to view the world (and become free of other's opinions) this is it. Freedom, truly is the freedom to be disliked as you will discover. Some of the language takes a bit of getting used too - there are new terms including seeing your fellow man as a 'comrade' in life rather than competition and I can't ever imagine calling anyone Comrade (!). However, the concepts are well worth chewing over and you will have to read the whole thing to get the benefit. I feel I have significantly shifted my views on my place in society as a result of these ideas. One to chew on.
