Couldn’t put it down. Buying a copy of this for each of my managers
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024
- **内容**: This book is dedicated to developing a customer value mindset across an organization and creating the flexibility for staff of all ranks to problem solve and innovate. It’s seductive in the way it lays out the conundrums on how high functioning teams should work but ultimately break down in practice. Just read chapter 4 on hard-wired misconceptions about product management and you’ll see what I mean. The authors generously offer concrete tools based on decades of learning that are less prescriptive and more relatable. Though written for smaller organizations in or seeking hyper-growth, the largest organizations can benefit greatly. As a director in a large financial institution strangled by its own processes, I found this book instantly relatable. I have long attempted to build a flexible, learning, and value driven team in a culture where rigid hierarchy and process reign supreme. This is the first book I’ve found that helps us accomplish that in a compelling and scaleable way with lots of guidance, examples and tools to support.

Read this and transform your company
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024
- **内容**: Company = Product. We all tend to forget it as companies scale, and organizing activities and managing people takes over from our real purpose: designing and delivering products people love. Build to Sell is a must-read for any entrepreneur or startup founder.The authors remind us that a sum of features do not a product make, and that good products are, in the end, the outcome of a culture of customer satisfaction, superior technical expertise and relentless teamwork.The book provides endless insights on what is a great product and how to structure the design process to get there. The authors' expertise and experience shine through in their clear and engaging writing style. Highly recommended!

A great translation of state-of-the-art product engineering to tech
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024
- **内容**: I loved Designing the Future from Jim Morgan and Jeffrey Liker. And they even made the effort to give examples o their Lean Product Development approach not just in manufacturing but also in tech environments.But if you are in tech and don’t have time to read all the books, it’s great to have the synthesis directly applicable to your context. That’s what Build to Sell is. It’s the book I will recommend people in tech from now on.

What you REALLY need to get right in business
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2024
- **内容**: A business is its product or service: it does something useful and pleasant, people buy it. It doesn't and it needs to expand vast amounts of energy to convince people to buy it. Getting products right, particularly digital products is the make/break skill for to scale.With the shift to digital products, much of the old skills of designing a product in hand, for customer delight, have been forgotten, and engineers now somehow believe a sum of features, each more elaborate than the next, make a product.Features do not a poduct make... but its usage does. In this brilliant, clear and easy to read book the authors give us a practical guide to think about products and to organize teams so that they improve their designs and indeed, build to sell, rather than build to fail. Don't miss this one - it's going to be a classic.

Inspiring, practical and accessible
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2024
- **内容**: This book is for everyone, not just "product professionals". As long as you are involved in designing, building, or selling something of value, you will find the advice in this book not just useful but indispensable. The authors explain the lean approach to product development using real-world anecdotes, for many types of products ranging from high-tech platforms to creative content and services. They lay out a clear roadmap to analyze the life of your customers and guarantee that the product you deliver fully satisfies their needs while engaging with their emotions to drive adoption. Most importantly, they show how to do this without falling into the common trap of "feature frenzy", where the product team inadvertently degrades the core experience by trying to deliver too much.

Very helpful for all stages of brand, company, & product development
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024
- **内容**: One of the very unique aspects of this book is its ability to really connect with both new entrepreneurs looking to create a project and develop a team from scratch while also being very insightful for already thriving businesses; Sandrine, Flavian, and Caroline accomplish this by refreshing and reframing the fundamentals of true entrepreneurship under the hybrid lens of practical community-building by way of the business/customer service being just as much the product as the product itself. Absolutely wonderful writing, and many examples of their conclusions that support the legitimacy of the ideas!

- **内容**: It's rare to read about lean engineering in the tech industry and I think it needs it!It is cheap to fail and rebuild software but not cheap enough not to try hard to build best in class products first time. The book provides techniques and examples to truly understand your clients and build products they will want to buy.
