| 内容简介 | INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “A cri de coeur that takes aim at the tech industry for abandoning its history of helping America and its allies.”—The Wall Street JournalFrom the Palantir co-founder, one of tech’s boldest thinkers and The Economist’s “best CEO of 2024,” and his deputy, a sweeping indictment of the West’s culture of complacency, arguing that timid leadership, intellectual fragility, and an unambitious view of technology’s potential in Silicon Valley have made the U.S. vulnerable in an era of mounting global threats.“Not since Allan Bloom’s astonishingly successful 1987 book The Closing of the American Mind—more than one million copies sold—has there been a cultural critique as sweeping as Karp’s.”—George F. Will, The Washington PostSilicon Valley has lost its way.Our most brilliant engineering minds once collaborated with government to advance world-changing technologies. Their efforts secured the West’s dominant place in the geopolitical order. But that relationship has now eroded, with perilous repercussions.Today, the market rewards shallow engagement with the potential of technology. Engineers and founders build photo-sharing apps and marketing algorithms, unwittingly becoming vessels for the ambitions of others. This complacency has spread into academia, politics, and the boardroom. The result? An entire generation for whom the narrow-minded pursuit of the demands of a late capitalist economy has become their calling.In this groundbreaking treatise, Palantir co-founder and CEO Alexander C. Karp and Nicholas W. Zamiska offer a searing critique of our collective abandonment of ambition, arguing that in order for the U.S. and its allies to retain their global edge—and preserve the freedoms we take for granted—the software industry must renew its commitment to addressing our most urgent challenges, including the new arms race of artificial intelligence. The government, in turn, must embrace the most effective features of the engineering mindset that has propelled Silicon Valley’s success.Above all, our leaders must reject intellectual fragility and preserve space for ideological confrontation. A willingness to risk the disapproval of the crowd, Karp and Zamiska contend, has everything to do with technological and economic outperformance.At once iconoclastic and rigorous, this book will also lift the veil on Palantir and its broader political project from the inside, offering a passionate call for the West to wake up to our new reality. |

Not about Palantir. A book about philosophy, sociology, and the not defining a moral stance.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2025
- **内容**: The Technological Republic is a fantastic book with varying subjects on what constitutes faith, society, purpose and national identity.The book although written before the 2024 election is deeply tied to the malaise that has been affecting our country for the better part of the last decade.This book is not so much about Palantir as it is about the essential societal consequences that has required the creation of such a company.If you are looking for a book about the company this is not the right book nor does one about this company exists at this time.However, if you are looking to read about cultural philosophy, moral negative impacts of moral relativism, lack of public opinions and affects of preference falsification, then this book may be for you.Check the table of contents before purchasing to get an idea of the subjects of each chapter.

Don't expect easy reading
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025
- **内容**: This book was a bit of a slog even though I completely agree with all salient points that the authors make. I suspected before purchase that this would likely be the case, but I gave it a whirl anyway. This is a sociology-philosophy book with only fleeting reference to the software world. The essence of the book is the progressive hollowing-out of the collective identity of western civilization in exchange for a more insipid, divisive, less spontaneous, less creative, directionless, and dangerous global soup of self-absorbed humans with near-zero attachment to their nation states and historical cultural tethers.Some chapters were a hard slog, while others were more coherent. I was most delighted when I unexpectedly reached the end of the book while my Kindle said I was still at 46%.

Revive of the West Civilization Through Technology
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2025
- **内容**: "The Technological Republic" by Alexander C. Karp and Nicholas W. Zamiska presents a compelling argument about the current state of Silicon Valley and its relationship with the West.Key Themes:The role of technology in society: The book explores the profound impact of technology on geopolitics, culture, and individual freedom.The importance of ambition and belief: The authors argue that a lack of ambition and a reluctance to engage in ideological debate have weakened the West.The need for collaboration: They emphasize the importance of partnership between the tech industry and government to address complex challenges.The future of the West: The book is ultimately concerned with the future of the West and its ability to maintain its values and influence in a rapidly changing world.While "The Technological Republic" strongly advocates for a renewed focus on national interests and a closer relationship between the tech industry and the government, it doesn't explicitly promote a narrow or aggressive form of nationalism.The book advocates for a partnership between the tech industry and the government, rather than a purely state-driven approach. This suggests a more collaborative and less nationalistic approach. While the book highlights "Western" values, it also emphasizes the importance of universal principles like freedom and truth, which transcend national boundaries.The book acknowledges the need to address global challenges like climate change and pandemics, which require international cooperation rather than a purely nationalistic approach.Overall, "The Technological Republic" is a thought-provoking and timely critique of the current state of Silicon Valley and its relationship with the West. It offers a compelling vision for a renewed partnership between technology and government, one that is grounded in ambition, intellectual rigor, and a commitment to the values of freedom and democracy.
