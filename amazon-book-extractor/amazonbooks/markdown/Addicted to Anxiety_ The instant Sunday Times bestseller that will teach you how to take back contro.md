- **标题**: Brilliant and it makes sense and it works.
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2025
- **内容**: I'd never thought that anxiety was an addiction till reading this book. Owen O'Kane (as with his other books) explains this in a clear, understandable and logical way without 'psychobabble' (that always turns me off other writers).What I love about this book are the practical examples of what to do when you're feeling anxious and how to break the addiction.Like anything else you have to practice them but I know they'll be successful as I've done the exercises from 'Ten to Zen' (his first book) and they really work.Thank you Owen O'Kane for this book - I'm now going to buy it in Audible!

- **内容**: As someone who has suffered from anxiety since childhood, I have come across many different solutions in dealing with it, some have work some haven’t but this book is a real game changer. It enables you to take a completely different approach to your anxiety and takes away that feel of “a irritating part of you” and gives you the insight and knowledge of how to co-exist with it.

- **标题**: Good book, the addiction link is nonsense
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2025
- **内容**: Good book, well written with lots of useful techniques and information. The "addiction" concept is nonsense though and the author clearly knows very little about addiction and 12 step recovery. A useful twist to position another book on anxiety I guess, but a weak construct that gets tired very quickly. Other than that it's a good book.
