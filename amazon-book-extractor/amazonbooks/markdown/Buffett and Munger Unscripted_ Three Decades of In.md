| 作者简介 | Alex Morris is the founder of TSOH Investment Research and the author of "Buffett And Munger Unscripted" |
| 内容简介 | For decades, thousands of people have gathered in Omaha, Nebraska for the Berkshire Hathaway AGM, and quizzed Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger on everything from the psychology of successful investors to the future of Coca-Cola and Apple. But unless you attended, for decades you only had access to what people remembered and reported back from Omaha.In 2018, Berkshire released the archives of the annual meetings going back to 1994. Alex Morris―an equities analyst and financial writer at the TSOH Investment Research Service―watched hundreds of hours of video from these annual meetings (as well as the six AGMs held since 2018), covering more than 1,700 questions asked by shareholders over the past 31 years. He then gathered, organized and edited the most interesting material into a comprehensive and accessible form. Buffett and Munger Unscripted is the result. From the art of intelligent capital allocation to the best ways to judge and compensate management, from understanding the nature of markets to embracing the power of long-term time horizons, this is a book with compelling insights on every page. In addition to collecting many famous quotes in their original context, it is a deep treasure trove of profound insights on all aspects of investing and business. Discover the importance of avoiding difficult decisions, the first question you should ask on a potential new investment, how to recover from unsuccessful investments, the importance of finding the right owners to partner with, Buffett and Munger’s book recommendations―and much more. The perfect companion to The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America and Poor Charlie’s Almanack, Buffett and Munger Unscripted belongs on the bookshelf of everyone interested in the keys to success in business and investing.Note: Alex will donate 50% of his net proceeds from "Unscripted" to GLIDE, a charitable organization that Warren Buffett has supported for years. While his philanthropic endeavors are not the focus of this book, that is another part of Warren’s life where he has been a role model. |

Learn to be a better investor
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025
- **内容**: Warren Buffett used to be on CNBC regularly, 2 to 3 times per year.  I watched EVERY time. I am convinced that those interviews made me a much better investor.  When CNBC released every Berkshire meeting, I spent a lot of time watching, they're excellent, you can learn, re-watch and get smarter about investing, smarter about Berkshire Hathaway.  Watching video is great, it's like you're in class.Alex takes this a step further with Unscripted.  It is organized perfectly.  If you want to learn about how advantaged BH Energy is, it is in the book.  If you want to learn about GEICO it's in the book.  Basically all the relevant comments that Buffett and Munger have uttered, its in the book.One may say, 'it's all on the internet already..'.  It is.  But reading it further pounds it in to your head.  If you like an idea, Alex time stamps where you can find it so you can read it and listen to it at the same time further solidifying the idea.Every time I open the book, I usually just open it to a random spot, I learn something I didn't know.Pages 14-16 provide a clear description of the kinds of businesses Buffett & Munger like, how they think about them, and what they don’t like.  I have heard this before, but reading it and underlining it, solidifies it into my head.I highly recommend buying the book and studying it.

Brilliant!
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025
- **内容**: So excited to finally have my hands on this! Alex Morris did a fantastic job organizing and editing three decades worth of material from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder Meetings. Buffet and Munger Unscripted belongs on the bookshelf of everyone interested on the keys to long-term success in business and investing! I’m a long time subscriber to Morris’s Substack, The Science Of Hitting, and he doesn’t disappoint! Not only am I excited to add this book to my collection, but knowing he’s donating half the book’s net proceeds to GLIDE is an extra bonus. Hats off to you on your astounding achievement!

Buffett and Munger Offer a Master Class in Investing for the Long Term
- **日期**: Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025
- **内容**: Imagine sitting beside two of the top investors of all time as they share over 150 years of combined stock market wisdom and common sense. For a bargain price of $45, you can capture their insights in this 473-page book. You can read it chapter by chapter or jump around based on your interests. You’ll find value in revisiting it as often as you like, and when you’re done, you can pass it on to your children and grandchildren, giving them a head start on becoming savvy investors.A big thank-you goes to Alex Morris, the author, who dedicated an extraordinary amount of time to assemble this volume in an organized, logical, and easy-to-follow format. Plus, he committed to donating 50% of the book's net profits to a charity backed by this dynamic duo.These two investing masters offer valuable insights, wisdom, common sense, and humor. Every investor interested in the stock market should read this book before hiring an advisor or risking a single dollar. Even seasoned investors will find guidance here useful for their future decisions.There are many Wall Street myths and gurus with poor track records. The myth emphasizes the importance of fundamental analysis and encourages buying solid businesses with excellent management and reliable financials. If your stock is taking a hit in the market, it’s wise to listen to Buffett and Munger, who suggest buying more as long as the fundamentals and outlook remain unchanged.Sadly, Munger, a humble and introspective man, passed away at age 99 on November 28, 2023. We lost one of the greats, but his legacy lives on in this book and in the others he has written, which I highly recommend. Buffett continues to lead Berkshire Hathaway, having established a solid management team to uphold their investment approach. His son, Howard, will monitor things closely as a board member and will become the non-executive chairman when his father is no longer at the helm.The book is divided into 13 chapters covering topics relevant to the company. It is essentially a compilation of 30 years of annual shareholder meeting details and notes from other events and meetings. The content is organized around themes like value investing, accounting, Mr. Market, and the Circle of Competence. Surprisingly, it doesn’t include an index, which is unusual for such a significant book.In summary, this is one of the best investment books available. I have over 500 books in my personal investment and trading library, and this one stands out. Take your time to read this monumental book to uncover the truths about investing from two straightforward truth-tellers.

- **日期**: Reviewed in Canada on January 28, 2025
- **内容**: This book is to Berkshire's annual meetings what Larry Cunningham's book is to Warren's letters. I have spent a lot of time listening to the audio of the annual meetings and gained so many insights, but Alex's book takes the cream of the crop and organizes it all by topic, allowing you to dig in on a topic and understand it so much better. It is like taking the annual meetings and injecting it right into your veins! A tremendous achievement to have written this awesome book.
